Seoul virus, a type of hantavirus, is carried by Norway rats and can make you sick. When people are infected with Seoul virus, they may have mild or no symptoms, but some people will develop serious illness that may require hospitalization. Rats that carry Seoul virus do not appear sick.  How do people get Seoul virus?  People get Seoul virus when:  They come in contact with urine, droppings, or saliva of infected rats. They breathe in virus particles. They get bitten by an infected rat.   You do not have to touch pet rats to get infected with Seoul virus or other germs.    How can you protect yourself and your pet rats from getting Seoul virus?   The best way to protect yourself is to prevent Seoul virus infections in pet rats.  Consult your veterinarian about testing new rats for Seoul virus before they are introduced to a new home, especially if they will be living with other rats in a home or breeding facility. Keep wild rats (which naturally carry Seoul virus) away from your pet rats by taking steps to prevent rodent infestations.   Pet rodents, including pet rats, are not recommended for families with children 5-years old or younger, pregnant women, or people with weakened immune systems as they are at a greater risk of serious illness.  How to safely care for your pet rat  Always wash hands immediately after touching, feeding, or caring for pet rats or cleaning their habitats Play safely. Do not kiss, nuzzle, or hold pet rats close to your face. Never eat, drink, or smoke while playing with or caring for your pet. Ensure rat enclosures are properly secured and safe so your pet does not get hurt or contaminate surfaces (pet rats can shed germs like Seoul virus that can contaminate areas where they live and roam). Keep pet rats and their supplies out of the kitchen or other areas where food is prepared, serviced, or eaten. Talk to your veterinarian about your pet’s health; they can help you and your pets stay healthy. Tell your healthcare provider that you have been around pet rats, especially if you are sick or have been bitten or scratched.  See general guidelines for safe rodent care.     How to safely clean up after your pet rat Preparing cleaning solution:  Seoul virus is sensitive to most general-purpose household disinfectants, including diluted bleach.  For commercial disinfectant, follow manufacturer’s instructions on the label and disinfection time.   Use these products in an area separate from where your rat is housed as rodents may be sensitive to disinfectant fumes.  Allow time for disinfected items to dry and air out before putting in contact with rats        Cleaning pet rat habitat: Soiled bedding is one way pet rat owners can become infected with Seoul virus. Take the following steps to prevent infections even if your rat is not known to be infected with Seoul virus.  Wear disposable waterproof gloves when cleaning up after pet rats. Clean and disinfect rodent habitats and supplies outside the home when possible for better ventilation. Use a laundry sink or bathtub in a well-ventilated area if cleaning rodent supplies indoors.  Never clean rodent habitats or their supplies in the kitchen sink, other food preparation area, or the bathroom sink. Clean and disinfect the area immediately after cleaning.   Wet down soiled bedding with disinfectant or bleach solution before bagging for trash disposal to reduce generating dust. Clean empty cages/enclosures with disinfectant or bleach solution and allow it to dry completely. Wet down spilled bedding or droppings with disinfectant or bleach solution before vacuuming. Wash hands immediately after cleaning pet rat habitat.  Extra cleaning and handling steps are needed if a pet rat is known or suspected of being infected with Seoul virus. Because rats infected with Seoul virus can transmit infection to other rats and people, CDC recommends euthanasia of infected rats. Please contact your veterinarian or public health department if you have a rat that you know or suspect may be infected with Seoul virus.

Seoul virus is a type of hantavirus. People that become infected with this virus often exhibit relatively mild or no disease but some will develop a form of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) with death in approximately 1-2% of cases (1 to 2 persons in 100 people).     Where is Seoul virus found and how does it spread?     Seoul virus is found worldwide. It is carried and spread by rodents, specifically the brown or Norway rat (Rattus norvegicus). The virus has been found in both pet rats and wild rat populations around the world.     How do people get infected with Seoul virus?     People can become infected with this virus after coming in contact with urine, droppings, or saliva of infected rodents. When fresh rodent urine, droppings, or nesting materials are stirred up (for example, when vacuuming or sweeping), tiny particles containing the virus get into the air. This process is known as “aerosolization”. You may become infected when you breathe in these contaminated materials. You may also become infected when the urine or these other materials containing the virus get directly into a cut or other broken skin or into your eyes, nose, or mouth. In addition, people who work with live rodents can get the Seoul virus through bites from infected animals. Seoul virus is not known to be spread from person to person.     What are the symptoms of Seoul virus infection?     When you get infected with Seoul virus, you may have the following symptoms:  Fever Headache Back and abdominal pain Chills Nausea Blurred vision Flushing of the face Inflammation or redness of the eyes Rash  Symptoms of the illness caused by Seoul virus usually begin within 1 to 2 weeks after contact with infectious material. Rarely, it may take up to 8 weeks to develop symptoms. In rare cases, infection can also lead to a type of acute renal disease called Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome (HFRS), which might include low blood pressure, acute shock, and acute kidney failure. However, Seoul virus infections are usually moderate and the vast majority of patients survive. Complete recovery can take weeks or months. Some people do not develop symptoms at all or have very mild symptoms.     How is infection with Seoul virus diagnosed?     Several laboratory tests of blood and body tissues are used to confirm a diagnosis of Seoul virus infection in patients suspected to have an infection.     How is infection with Seoul virus treated?     Supportive care is given to patients with Seoul virus infections. Care includes fluid therapy by giving the patient liquids directly into the vein to maintain blood volume, blood pressure, and electrolyte (sodium, potassium, chloride) levels. Oxygen mask may also be used as well as appropriate treatment of any secondary infections. Dialysis may be required in severe cases of kidney failure. Ribavirin, an antiviral drug, has been shown to reduce the illness severity and lower deaths related to Seoul virus infections if used very early in the disease.     How is Seoul virus infection prevented?     Avoiding contact with rats and rodent control are key for preventing Seoul virus infections. Rodents near human communities should be controlled, and rodents should be excluded from homes. You should avoid contact with rodent urine, droppings, saliva, and nesting materials. It is important to know how to safely clean up after rodents.     How do rats get infected with Seoul virus?     Seoul virus is shed in the urine, feces, and saliva of recently infected rats. Rats can become infected with Seoul virus through wounding or biting other rats and after coming in contact with the urine and feces of infected rats.     How do I know if my pet rat is infected with Seoul virus?     Rats do not show symptoms of disease when they are infected with Seoul virus. Rats that may have come from a facility where rats have been confirmed with infection can be tested for evidence of viral infection in a laboratory. Once infected, rats can continue to shed virus throughout their lives, potentially infecting both other rats and humans.", "reports": [{"diseases": ["hantavirus"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": [{"geonames_id": 1835848}, {"geonames_id": 3144096}]}]},

Several people were infected after contact with infected rats. Some infected individuals were hospitalized and recovered. Concerned rat owners may ask veterinarians about Seoul virus, and this document provides information about:  Seoul virus basics Diagnostic testing in rats Disease prevention methods  Seoul Virus Basics Seoul virus is a type of hantavirus that is carried primarily by Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus). Seoul virus-infected rats shed the virus in their urine, feces, and saliva. Rats become infected while commingling, fighting, or mating with infected rats, or through contaminated materials such as bedding. Rats do not show any clinical signs when infected, and can shed the virus chronically for several months. People can become infected with Seoul virus after breathing in aerosolized particles, getting bitten, or when a person’s mucous membranes or breaks in their skin come in direct contact with virus-containing materials while handling rats or cleaning cages. Because rats infected with Seoul virus can transmit infection to other rats and people, CDC recommends euthanasia of infected rats. Diagnostic Testing in Rats When a Seoul virus outbreak occurs, public health authorities may reach out to rat owners if they purchased rats from or sold rats to a facility with infected humans or rats. CDC recommends that all rats that came from an affected facility be tested. Some states may require testing these animals as part of their outbreak control measures. In other cases, rat owners may not know if their rats came from an affected facility. They may want to test their current rats to see if they are infected, or they may want to test newly purchased animals to prevent the virus from being introduced to their other rats. Commercial diagnostic tests are available to determine if a rat has been exposed to Seoul virus. For more information on Seoul virus, including options for testing. Types of Tests CDC recommends serologic testing to determine if a rat is infected with Seoul virus. This testing detects antibodies (IgG) to Hantaviruses, including Seoul virus. Acceptable specimens include ~100 uL of blood in EDTA micro vials or blood applied to a spot card. A positive serology result means that the rat has been infected with Seoul virus and can pose a risk for spreading Seoul virus to other rats or to people. A negative result means there is no evidence of Seoul virus exposure in the rat at the time of the sampling. Antibodies are detectable within 4 weeks of exposure. Rats can have detectable antibodies and shed virus at the same time. PCR testing detects Hantavirus RNA in blood, organ tissues, or other fluids. Because rats can intermittently shed virus when they are infected, PCR testing is NOT RECOMMENDED as the primary diagnostic test. Print Factsheet Information for Veterinarians: Testing for Seoul Virus in Pet Rats Cdc-pdf[231KB, 3-pages, HTML] Disease Prevention Methods for Veterinarians and Veterinary Staff Handling of rats NOT known or suspected of being infected with Seoul virus: Use standard precautions when performing physical exams and procedures with all animals. The National Association of State Public Health Veterinarians has developed a Compendium of Veterinary Standard Precautions that provides guidance intended to minimize transmission of zoonotic pathogens to veterinary personnel. Review the 2015 Compendium Cdc-pdf[PDF -27 pages]External. Handling of rats KNOWN to be infected with Seoul virus, or from a facility with human or rodent infections: Seoul virus is transmitted by aerosols or direct contact. For veterinary procedures involving rats from facilities with confirmed Seoul virus cases, airborne and droplet transmission precautions are recommended. This includes hand-washing, gloves, face shield or goggles, protective outer garments, and respiratory protection (such as N95 or N99 particulate respirators, or a powered air-purifying respirator [PAPR]**).  See Personal Protective Equipment for Veterinarians and Veterinary Staff. In addition, veterinary staff should use such personal protective equipment when handling soiled bedding or cleaning the cages of rodents suspected of Seoul virus infection.  Ensure staff understand how to handle rodents, including during any planned procedures (such as blood draws or euthanasia). Provide training in advance. Schedule this appointment as the last appointment of the day, or at a time when the clinic is less busy. Request that the client bring rat(s) in a bare cage or carrier with no bedding. Suggest that the client drape a towel across the outside of the cage during transit. If possible, admit the client through a side entrance, rather than through the main lobby. When the client arrives, bring them directly into an exam room.  If the work surface or personnel’s gloves or clothing became contaminated with rodent excreta or blood during the handling procedures, a spray bottle of disinfectant should be available and used to spray the contaminated area. After disinfection, clothing may be laundered normally. After the visit, wipe down all surfaces, including the cage/carrier that the rat was transported in, with an appropriate disinfectant. Allow to air dry. Personal Protective Equipment for Veterinarians and Veterinary Staff Any staff who will be directly handling a rat known to be infected with Seoul virus or performing veterinary procedures on it should follow droplet and aerosol transmission guidance, including:  Fluid-impermeable disposable surgical gown Two pairs of non-powdered nitrile medical-grade gloves plus a thick protective glove. Protective gloves may be made of leather or of fabric with a rubber outer coating that is resistant to puncture from rodent bites or scratches and is easy to disinfect. A NIOSH-certified N95 filtering facepiece respirator or higher or a powered air purifying respirator (PAPR) equipped with a high-efficiency particulate air filter (HEPA).  Note: Respirator use should be in the context of a complete respiratory protection program in accordance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Respiratory Protection standard (29 CFR 1910.134) and other requirements. Staff who will need to wear N95 (or higher) respirators should be medically cleared, trained, and fit-tested for respirator use. Detailed information on respiratory protection programs, including fit testing procedures, can be accessed at OSHA’s Respiratory Protection eToolExternal.  Tight-fitting respirators cannot be used by people with facial hair that comes between the sealing surface of the facepiece and the face; loose-fitting powered air purifying respirators (PAPRs) can be worn by those with facial hair. If a filtering facepiece respirator is worn, also wear a disposable full face shield or goggles to protect mucous membranes from any accidental splashes of rodent urine or blood.   Fluid impermeable disposable surgical gown   Two pairs of non-powdered nitrile medical-grade gloves plus a thick protective glove   A NIOSH-certified N95 filtering facepiece respirator or higher or a powered air purifying respirator (PAPR) equipped with a high-efficiency particulate air filter (HEPA).   A disposable full face shield or goggles  Remove personal protective equipment Cdc-pdf[PDF – 3 pages] following these guidelines:  Remove outside pair of gloves, face shield, and protective gown. Wash hands with soap and water (with second pair of gloves still on). Remove second pair of gloves. Wash your hands with soap and water again.  Reporting of Illness Veterinary staff and rat owners should receive information about the signs and symptoms of Seoul virus infection. Employers should document which employees handle potential infected animals and the date(s) of potential exposure. If anyone who handled infected rats develops sudden flu-like symptoms occur within 8 weeks after exposure to a new rodent or after a bite, scratch, or breach of PPE, they should seek health care promptly and inform their employer and local health department, making them aware of any recent animal contact. Handling Euthanasia Requests If an owner requests euthanasia, follow AVMA-approved methods Cdc-pdf[PDF – 102 pages]External. After euthanasia:  Spray carcass with a disinfectant or a mixture of bleach and water. Place carcass in a biohazard bag for infectious waste. Gently close the bag at the top and seal shut with tape. Avoid squeezing or pressing the bag to get excess air out. Spray outside of this bag with disinfectant or bleach solution. Place the taped, sprayed, biohazard bag into a second empty biohazard bag. Gently close this bag at the top and seal shut with tape. Avoid squeezing or pressing the bag to get excess air out. Spray outside of this bag with disinfectant or bleach solution. Rat carcasses may be incinerated, buried, or disposed of using routine procedures for carcass handling at the veterinary hospital, ensuring workers do not open the bags before disposal.  Disinfectants  Hantaviruses like Seoul virus are sensitive to dilute hypochlorite solutions (10% household bleach), Lysol and other phenolics, detergents, and most general-purpose household disinfectants. A 1% (1:100 dilution) solution of household bleach is an adequate surface disinfectant which can be used for wiping down potentially contaminated surfaces. For heavily soiled areas or items contaminated with rodent feces or nesting items, a 10% solution is recommended. An appropriate disinfectant should always be used:  To decontaminate traps which contained or were soiled by rodents To clean rubber gloves after handling traps which contain rodents or that have been soiled by rodents To clean gloved hands after each rodent is handled and before removing gloves To soak and disinfect instruments and other equipment To clean working surfaces and other items that may have been contaminated by handling rodents    For more information on Seoul virus, including options for testing of rats.  \n \n PDF      \r         file_external", "reports": [{"diseases": ["hantavirus"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "2015-xx-xx xx:xx:xx", "locations": [{"geonames_id": 1835848}, {"geonames_id": 11887752}, {"geonames_id": 3144096}]}]},

Questions  I’m from the U.S. and stayed in Yosemite National Park recently. Should I seek medical attention? I was hiking in Yosemite for just one day in July. During my hike, I didn’t see or touch any rodents. Am I at risk for developing Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome? I visited Yosemite National Park recently. I now have a headache, have vomited, and have diarrhea. What should I do? I had lunch in Curry Village in Yosemite, but I did not stay there. Am I at risk for developing HPS? When I was in Yosemite National Park recently, I saw a mouse in my tent. Should I seek medical attention? I visited Yosemite National Park in May of 2012. After returning home, I felt sick, with symptoms that resemble HPS. I’m well now. What should I do? I stayed in Yosemite National Park in the summer of 2011, over a year ago. Am I at risk for HPS? Is there a test for HPS? If my doctor thinks I may have HPS, how can I get tested? How is HPS treated? Is there a vaccine for HPS? I was in Yosemite National Park in May 2012, staying at the “Signature Tent Cabins” in Curry Village. I am feeling fine. Is there still a chance that I could become sick with Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome? I was in Yosemite National Park on August 16, 2012. I never had any symptoms after returning home. Should I be tested, just to be sure that I am not infected? Do I have to have all the symptoms listed on the CDC webpage in order to have Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome? My girlfriend/boyfriend was hiking and camping in Yosemite in August 2012. Can I become infected through contact with her/him?    I’m from the U.S. and stayed in Yosemite National Park recently. Should I seek medical attention? If you exhibit any symptoms of HPS, seek medical attention immediately. Early HPS symptoms include fatigue, fever and muscle aches, especially in the large muscle groups—thighs, hips, back, and sometimes shoulders. These symptoms occur in all instances of HPS infection. There may also be headaches, dizziness, chills, and abdominal problems, such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. About half of all HPS patients experience these symptoms. Four to 10 days after the initial phase of illness, the late symptoms of HPS may appear. These include coughing and shortness of breath, with the sensation, as one former HPS patient put it, of a “tight band around my chest and a pillow over my face,” as the lungs fill with fluid. If you subsequently develop respiratory difficulties or shortness of breath, you should immediately seek medical attention.

During my hike, I didn’t see or touch any rodents. Am I at risk for developing Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome? The risk of contracting HPS while hiking is extremely low. HPS is a very rare disease. In the U.S., the type of hantavirus that causes HPS is known as Sin Nombre Hantavirus. The host of the Sin Nombre hantavirus is the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus), which is present throughout the western and central U.S., including Yosemite National Park. It is important to note that approximately 12 percent of deer mice carry the virus. Also, after the virus is excreted in the deer mouse’s urine or feces, it quickly becomes inactivated and non-infectious. So, if you were hiking in Yosemite for the day and did not touch or see any rodents, there is very little risk for HPS.   I visited Yosemite National Park recently. I now have a headache, have vomited, and have diarrhea. What should I do? Early HPS symptoms include fatigue, fever and muscle aches, especially in the large muscle groups—thighs, hips, back, and sometimes shoulders. These symptoms occur in all instances of HPS infection. There may also be headaches, dizziness, chills, and abdominal problems, such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. About half of all HPS patients experience these symptoms. Therefore, you should contact your health provider to determine if testing for HPS is needed. If you subsequently develop respiratory difficulties or shortness of breath, you should seek immediate medical care.   I had lunch in Curry Village in Yosemite, but I did not stay there. Am I at risk for developing HPS? HPS is a very rare disease. In the U.S., the type of hantavirus that causes HPS is known as Sin Nombre Hantavirus. The primary host of the Sin Nombre hantavirus is the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus), which is present throughout the western and central U.S., including Yosemite National Park. It is important to note that not that fewer than 20 percent of deer mice carry the virus. Also, after the virus is excreted in the deer mouse’s urine or feces, it quickly becomes inactivated and non-infectious. So, if you visited Yosemite but did not stay there for long, and you didn’t touch or see any rodents, there is very little risk for HPS.   When I was in Yosemite National Park recently, I saw a mouse in my tent. Should I seek medical attention? Not unless symptoms appear. Early HPS symptoms include fatigue, fever and muscle aches, especially in the large muscle groups—thighs, hips, back, and sometimes shoulders. These symptoms occur in all instances of HPS infection. There may also be headaches, dizziness, chills, and abdominal problems, such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. About half of all HPS patients experience these symptoms. Four to 10 days after the initial phase of illness, the late symptoms of HPS may appear. These include coughing and shortness of breath, with the sensation, as one former HPS patient put it, of a “tight band around my chest and a pillow over my face,” as the lungs fill with fluid. If you subsequently develop respiratory difficulties or shortness of breath, you should immediately seek medical attention.   I visited Yosemite National Park in May of 2012. After returning home, I felt sick, with symptoms that resemble HPS. I’m well now. What should I do? Contact your doctor or your state epidemiologistExternal. Mention your symptoms and your travel to Yosemite. They will decide if a laboratory test is needed to determine whether you had HPS.   I stayed in Yosemite National Park in the summer of 2011, over a year ago. Am I at risk for HPS? No. Symptoms of the disease may occur anywhere from 1-6 weeks after exposure to the virus. Typically, it’s 2-4 weeks. So, since it was over a year ago, there’s no reason to believe you’re at risk for HPS.   Is there a test for HPS? Yes. Testing for HPS is possible in a specialized laboratory. Only a laboratory test can confirm if you have or had HPS. Diagnosing clinical HPS in an individual who has been infected for only a few days is difficult, because early symptoms such as fever, muscle aches, and fatigue are easily confused with other illnesses.   If my doctor thinks I may have HPS, how can I get tested? Some state health departments maintain laboratories that can test for HPS. State health departments that cannot test for HPS can send blood samples to CDC for diagnostic testing, but only after prior consultation with CDC. Because HPS is a nationally notifiable disease, your doctor should contact your state health department to report suspected cases and follow their guidance on submission of samples for HPS testing. State-specific information on submission of samples for testing   How is HPS treated? Is there a vaccine for HPS? There is no specific treatment, cure, or vaccine for HPS. However, if infected individuals are recognized early and receive medical care in an intensive care unit, they may do better. In intensive care, patients are given oxygen therapy or undergo an intubation procedure (insertion of a flexible tube in the airway) to help them through the period of severe respiratory distress. If you have been around rodents and have symptoms of fever, deep muscle aches, and severe shortness of breath, see your doctor immediately. Be sure to tell your doctor that you have been around rodents.   I was in Yosemite National Park in May 2012, staying at the “Signature Tent Cabins” in Curry Village. I am feeling fine. Is there still a chance that I could become sick with Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome? No. Because the incubation of hantavirus is between one and six weeks, and because your stay in May puts you ‘outside’ that incubation period, you are not at risk for developing Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome related to your stay in Curry Village.   I was in Yosemite National Park on August 16, 2012. I never had any symptoms after returning home. Should I be tested, just to be sure that I am not infected? People without any symptoms should not be tested. However, the incubation period of the virus is from one to six weeks. You should monitor your health until the end of September, six weeks after your visit in mid-August. For persons who do not have any symptoms of Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome, testing does not yield meaningful results. For testing to be definitive, symptoms should be present for 3-4 days, in order to measure your immune system’s response to the virus.   Do I have to have all the symptoms listed on the CDC webpage in order to have Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome? No. However, some symptoms, or groups of symptoms, are more indicative than others. If you are feeling sick with a high fever and develop any difficulty breathing, seek medical attention immediately. If you had any recent potential exposure to deer mice (including camping in Yosemite), tell your healthcare provider about it and mention hantavirus.   My girlfriend/boyfriend was hiking and camping in Yosemite in August 2012. Can I become infected through contact with her/him? No. There is no documented human-to-human transmission of hantavirus in the US.  \n \n \r         file_external", "reports": [{"diseases": ["hantavirus"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "2011-xx-xx xx:xx:xx", "locations": [{"geonames_id": 7648741}, {"geonames_id": 11887752}, {"geonames_id": 7175949}, {"geonames_id": 6255150}, {"geonames_id": 5350939}]}]},
