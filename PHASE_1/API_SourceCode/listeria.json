Even when there are no ongoing outbreaks, people who are at higher risk for getting sick with Listeria\u00a0should avoid eating deli meats, unless heated to an internal temperature of 165\u00b0F or until steaming hot.\n\nCDC, public health and regulatory officials in several states, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s Food Safety and Inspection Service (USDA-FSIS) investigated a multistate outbreak of Listeria monocytogenes infections linked to deli meats.\nFinal Outbreak Information\n\n\nAt A Glance\n\n\nReported Cases: 12\nStates: 4\nHospitalizations: 12\nDeaths: 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12 people infected with the outbreak strain of Listeria were reported from Florida, Louisiana, Massachusetts, and New York.\n\nAll 12 people were hospitalized. One death was reported from Florida.\n\n\nEpidemiologic evidence showed that deli meat was the likely source of this outbreak.\n\nIn interviews with 11 ill people, all reported eating Italian-style meats, such as salami, mortadella, and prosciutto. They reported purchasing prepackaged deli meats and meats sliced at deli counters at various locations.\n\n\nA specific type of deli meat or a common supplier was not identified.\nDeli meats, also called lunch meat or cold cuts, can have Listeria bacteria. Always follow food safety steps to prevent getting sick from Listeria in deli meats, even when there are no ongoing outbreaks.\n\nAdvice to People at Higher Risk for Listeria Infection\n\nYou are at higher risk for getting sick with Listeria if you are pregnant, aged 65 or older, or have a weakened immune system due to medical conditions such as cancer, diabetes, liver or kidney disease, alcoholism, or HIV. Treatments that make it more difficult for the body to fight off illness, such as steroids and chemotherapy, also can increase the chance of Listeria infection.

However, infections during pregnancy can lead to miscarriage, stillbirth, premature delivery, or life-threatening infection of the newborn.\nPeople who are not pregnant may experience symptoms that include headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance, and convulsions in addition to fever and muscle aches.\n\n\nPeople with invasive listeriosis usually report symptoms starting 1 to 4 weeks after eating food contaminated with Listeria; some people have reported symptoms starting as late as 70 days after exposure or as early as the same day of exposure.\nFor more information, see Symptoms of Listeria Infection.\n\nInvestigation DetailsJanuary 28, 2021\nCDC, public health and regulatory officials in several states, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s Food Safety and Inspection Service (USDA-FSIS) investigated a multistate outbreak of Listeria monocytogenes infections.\nPublic health investigators used the PulseNet system to identify illnesses that were part of this outbreak. PulseNet is the national subtyping network of public health and food regulatory agency laboratories coordinated by CDC. DNA fingerprinting was performed on Listeria bacteria isolated from ill people by using a standardized laboratory and data analysis method called whole genome sequencing (WGS). CDC PulseNet manages a national database of these sequences that are used to identify possible outbreaks. WGS gives investigators detailed information about the bacteria causing illness. In this investigation, WGS showed that bacteria isolated from ill people were closely related genetically. This means that people in this outbreak were more likely to share a common source of infection.\nAs of January 26, 2021, a total of 12 people infected with the outbreak strain of Listeria monocytogenes were reported from four states. A list of the states and the number of cases in each can be found on the Map of Reported Cases page.\nListeria samples from ill people were collected from August 6, 2020, to October 30, 2020. Ill people ranged in age from 40 to 89 years, with a median age of 81 years, and 83% were female. All 12 people were hospitalized, and one death was reported from Florida.\nInvestigation of the Outbreak\nEpidemiologic evidence showed that deli meat was the likely source of this outbreak.\nState and local public health officials interviewed ill people about the foods they ate in the month before they became ill. Of the 11 people interviewed, all reported eating Italian-style deli meats, such as salami, mortadella, and prosciutto. They reported purchasing prepackaged deli meats and meats sliced at deli counters at various locations.\nUSDA-FSIS and state officials reviewed records collected from stores where ill people purchased deli meats to find a common supplier of deli meats. They also tested deli meat products that ill people reported eating. However, they did not find a common supplier or a specific type of deli meat as the source of this outbreak.\nAs of January 28, 2021, this outbreak is over.\nPrevious Updates >>\nOutbreak By the Numbersmap iconMap of Reported Caseschart iconTimeline of Reported CasesKey Resources\nQuestions and Answers on Listeria\nPreventing Listeria infection \nFour Steps to Food Safety", "reports": [{"diseases": ["listeriosis"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "2020-12-xx xx:xx:xx to 2020-10-30 xx:xx:xx", "locations": [{"geonames_id": 11874184}, {"geonames_id": 5128581}, {"geonames_id": 6254926}, {"geonames_id": 4155751}]}]}{"url": "https://www.cdc.gov/listeria/outbreaks/enoki-mushrooms-03-20/index.html", "date_of_publication": "", "headline": "Outbreak of Listeria Infections Linked to Enoki Mushroom", "main_text": "Outbreak of Listeria Infections Linked to Enoki MushroomsFinal Update   \n\n\nPosted June 9, 2020 at 11:00 AM ET\n\nFor information in Korean (\ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4) or Chinese (\u7b80\u4f53\u4e2d\u6587), visit\u00a0FDA\u2019s outbreak investigation pageexternal icon.\nThis outbreak appears to be over.

Ill people ranged in age from less than 1 to 96 years, with a median age of 67. Fifty-eight percent of ill people were female. Of 33 ill people with information available, 31 hospitalizations were reported. Four deaths were reported from California (2), Hawaii, and New Jersey.

Twelve out of 22 (55%) reported eating mushrooms, including enoki, portobello, white, button, cremini, wood ear, maitake, and oyster.\nFDA and state officials collected enoki mushrooms for testing. The Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development collected enoki mushrooms from a grocery store where an ill person shopped and identified the outbreak strain in two samples.

People who have underlying medical conditions or take medicines (like steroids or chemotherapy) that lower the body\u2019s ability to fight germs and sickness have weakened immune systems.\nSome foods are more likely to contain Listeria.

A food is shelf-stable if it can be safely stored at room temperature.\nChoose pasteurized milk and milk products, including soft cheese, ice cream, and yogurt.\n\nSymptoms of Listeria Infection\n\n\nListeriosis can cause different symptoms, depending on the person and the part of the body affected.\n\nPregnant women typically experience only fever and other flu-like symptoms, such as fatigue and muscle aches. However, infections during pregnancy can lead to miscarriage, stillbirth, premature delivery, or life-threatening infection of the newborn.\nPeople other than pregnant women: Symptoms can include headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance, and convulsions in addition to fever and muscle aches.\n\n\nPeople with invasive listeriosis usually report symptoms starting 1 to 4 weeks after eating food contaminated with Listeria.
