The hepatitis A virus is found in the stool and blood of people who are infected. The hepatitis A virus is spread when someone ingests the virus, usually through close personal contact with an infected person or from eating contaminated food or drink. Hepatitis A can be prevented with a vaccine, which is recommended for all children at age one and adults at risk.\nSymptoms of Hepatitis A\n\n\nSymptoms of hepatitis A usually appear 2 to 7 weeks after exposure and can include\n\nYellow skin or eyes\nNot wanting to eat\nUpset stomach\nStomach pain\nThrowing up\nFever\nDark urine or light-colored stools\nJoint pain\nDiarrhea\nFeeling tired\n\n\nNot everyone with hepatitis A has symptoms. Adults are more likely to have symptoms than children.\nPeople who get hepatitis A may feel sick for a few weeks to several months but usually recover completely and do not have lasting liver damage. In some people, though, the illness may be so severe that the patient needs to be hospitalized.\nIn rare cases, hepatitis A can cause liver failure and even death. This is more common in older people and in people with other serious health issues, such as chronic liver disease.\n\nFinal Investigation DetailsFebruary 19, 2020\nCDC, public health and regulatory officials in several states, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)external icon investigated a multistate outbreak of hepatitis A associated with exposure to contaminated fresh blackberries sold at Fresh Thyme Farmers Market and Woodman\u2019s grocery stores during September 2019.\nAs of February 19, 2020, a total of 20 outbreak-associated cases of hepatitis A were reported from 7 states. A list of the states and the number of cases in each is found on the Map of Reported Cases page.\nIllnesses started on dates ranging from October 8, 2019, to November 15, 2019. Ill people ranged in age from 14 to 73 years, with a median age of 50. Sixty percent of ill people were female. Of 19 people with available information, 11 (58%) were hospitalized. No deaths were reported.\nInvestigation of the Outbreak\nEpidemiologic and traceback evidence indicated that fresh blackberries were the likely source of this outbreak.\nIn interviews, ill people answered questions about the foods they ate and other exposures\u00a0in the 2 to 7 weeks before they became ill. Of people who were interviewed, 19/20 (95%) reported eating fresh blackberries; of 17 people with known fresh blackberry purchase location information, 16/17 (94%) purchased fresh blackberries from either Fresh Thyme Farmers Market or Woodman\u2019s Market. This proportion was significantly higher than results from a survey pdf icon[PDF \u2013 29 pages]\u00a0of healthy people in which 7% reported eating fresh blackberries in the week before they were interviewed.\nFDA completed its traceback investigation; however, a single, common source of fresh, conventional blackberries could not be identified.\nAs of February 19, 2020, this outbreak investigation is over.\nKey Resources\n\nCDC Hepatitis A Fact Sheet pdf icon[PDF \u2013 2 pages]\nCDC hepatitis A Q&A for the public\nCDC Postexposure Prophylaxis for Hepatitis A\nHow to Report a Foodborne Illness\nCDC\u2019s Food Safety Information", "reports": [{"diseases": ["hepatitis a"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "2019-12-xx xx:xx:xx to 2019-11-15 xx:xx:xx", "locations": [{"geonames_id": 4887398}, {"geonames_id": 5001836}, {"geonames_id": 5279468}, {"geonames_id": 5073708}, {"geonames_id": 12213487}, {"geonames_id": 5037779}, {"geonames_id": 12213626}, {"geonames_id": 12217084}]}]},

Hepatitis A is a contagious liver disease that results from infection with the hepatitis A virus. \u00a0It can range in severity from a mild illness lasting a few weeks to a severe illness lasting several months. \u00a0Although rare, people have died from infection with hepatitis A. Symptoms appear between 15 and 50 days after infection and can include yellow eyes or skin, abdominal pain, or pale stools.\nEpidemiologic and traceback evidence indicate frozen strawberries imported from Egypt were the likely source of this outbreak.\n\nIn interviews, nearly all ill people interviewed reported drinking smoothies containing strawberries at Tropical Smoothie Caf\u00e9 locations prior to August 8 in a limited geographical area, including Maryland, North Carolina, Virginia, and West Virginia, but there have been a small number of cases outside of that geographic area with no Tropical Smoothie Caf\u00e9 exposure.\n\n\nInformation available at this time does not indicate an ongoing risk of acquiring hepatitis A virus infection at Tropical Smoothie Caf\u00e9\u2019s, as the contaminated food product has been removed as of August 8. As of December 13, 2016:\n\n143 people with hepatitis A have been reported from nine states: Arkansas (1), California (1), Maryland (12), New York (5), North Carolina (4), Oregon (1), Virginia (109), West Virginia (7), and Wisconsin (3).\n\n\n129 of these cases reported eating a smoothie from Tropical Smoothie Caf\u00e9. There have been no cases reporting illness from this same exposure since September 23, 2016.\n\n14 cases had no direct exposure to Tropical smoothie caf\u00e9. The latest illness onset date among these cases was October 25, 2016.\n56 ill people were hospitalized. No deaths were reported.\n\n\nFDA traceback information indicated that the frozen strawberries served in the Tropical Smoothie Caf\u00e9 locations were from the International Company for Agricultural Production & Processing (ICAPP), imported from Egypt. On August 8, 2016, Tropical Smoothie Caf\u00e9 reported that they removed the Egyptian frozen strawberries from their restaurants in Maryland, North Carolina, Virginia, and West Virginia and switched to another supplier out of an abundance of caution. Information available at this time does not indicate an ongoing risk of hepatitis A virus infection at Tropical Smoothie Cafes.\nOn October 30, 2016, the International Company for Agricultural Production & Processing (ICAPP) recalled\u00a0all of its frozen strawberries that were imported into the U.S. since January 1, 2016. The recalled products were distributed for sale to and use in food service establishments nationwide.\n\nThe FDA reports that hepatitis A virus contamination was found in multiple samples of ICAPP frozen strawberries.\n\n\nThis investigation is considered complete.\n\n\n\n\nInitial Announcement - September 1, 2016\n\n\n\nTextbox module not selected or not found.\n\n\nFrozen Strawberry Recall\nOn October 30, 2016, ICAPP announced that it had notified its distributors that frozen strawberries were being recalled due to a potential contamination with hepatitis A.\u00a0\nICAPP Distributors are required to notify facilities/retailers that have received the frozen strawberries\n\nRecalled products were distributed for sale to and use in in facilities (nursing homes, schools, etc) \u00a0nationwide.\nNotification is ongoing.\n\n\nFacilities and retailers should not sell or serve recalled frozen strawberries.\n\n\n\nAdvice to Facilities who have received notification from ICAPP Distributors\nIf the facility has served any of the recalled frozen strawberries in the last 2 weeks since the notification , contact their local health department for further instructions and consideration of post exposure prophylaxis (PEP)\nIf the facility has received any of the recalled frozen strawberries but has not served them to anyone, any remaining product should be discarded and no further action is needed.\n\n\nAdvice to Public Health Officials\n\nBecause hepatitis A can have serious health consequences, CDC recommends providing post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for unvaccinated people who have eaten recalled strawberries in the last 2 weeks. PEP consists of:\n\nHepatitis A vaccine for people between the ages of 1 and 40 years\nHepatitis A virus-specific immunoglobulin (IG) for people outside of this age range. If immunoglobulin is not available, hepatitis A vaccine can be substituted\nThose with evidence of previous vaccination do not require PEP\n\n\n\nNOTE: CDC recommends that all children be vaccinated against hepatitis A at age 1.\u00a0 Any parent or caregiver who is unsure if a child has been vaccinated should consult their health care provider and confirm vaccination status.\n\nAdvice to ConsumersInformation available at this time does not indicate an ongoing risk of hepatitis A virus infection at Tropical Smoothie Cafes.\n\nIt is possible that you might be contacted by an institution (i.e., school, nursing home) and told that you or a family member was exposed to recalled frozen strawberries.\u00a0 \n\nIf you are unsure if you have been vaccinated against hepatitis A, contact your health professional to check your immunization records.\u00a0 If you have been vaccinated, no further action is needed.\u00a0 If you have never received the hepatitis A vaccine, getting a single dose within two weeks of exposure can protect against illness.\u00a0 Because hepatitis A can have serious health consequences, CDC recommends post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for unvaccinated people who have eaten recalled strawberries in the last 2 weeks. PEP consists of:\n\nHepatitis A vaccine for people between the ages of 1 and 40 years\nHepatitis A virus-specific immunoglobulin (IG) for people outside of this age range, but the hepatitis A vaccine can be substituted if IG is not available.\nThose with evidence of previous vaccination do not require PEP\n\n\n\nSymptoms can occur anywhere from 15 to 50 days after exposure, but not everyone will experience symptoms from a hepatitis A virus infection. Some people may experience mild flu-like symptoms. Other symptoms of hepatitis A virus infection include:\n\nYellow eyes or skin\nAbdominal pain\nPale stools\nDark urine\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Hepatitis A PreventionCases of hepatitis A have decreased dramatically over the last decade in large part due to successful vaccination programs and policies. Most new cases of hepatitis A are now related to international travel, and occasional foodborne outbreaks. Once a person becomes ill from hepatitis A, the virus can be easily transmitted to household or sexual partners. Thorough hand washing can help minimize transmission among close contacts.\nThe hepatitis A vaccine is recommended as part of routine childhood vaccinations and for adults at high risk. CDC recommends the following groups be vaccinated against hepatitis A:\n\nAll children at age 1 year\nTravelers to countries that have high rates of hepatitis A\nFamily members and caregivers of recent adoptees from countries where hepatitis A is common\nMen who have sexual contact with other men\nUsers of injection and non-injection illegal drugs\nPeople with chronic liver disease\nPeople who are treated with clotting-factor concentrates\nPeople who work with hepatitis A infected animals or in a hepatitis A research laboratory\n\n\n\n\nAt a Glance\nCase Count: 143\nStates: 9\nDeaths: 0\nHospitalizations: 56\nRecall: Yes\n\n\nLatest Case Count Map\nClick map to view case count map and table.\n\nMore Information\nVirginia Department of Health Hepatitis A Investigationexternal icon\nFDA Investigates Outbreak of Hepatitis A Illnesses Linked to Frozen Strawberriesexternal icon\nCDC Hepatitis A Questions and Answers for the Public\nCDC Hepatitis A Questions and Answers for Health Professionals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n\nPosted December 16, 2016 2:30 PM ET\nThis particular outbreak appears to be over.

As of December 13, 2016:\n\n143 people with hepatitis A have been reported from nine states: Arkansas (1), California (1), Maryland (12), New York (5), North Carolina (4), Oregon (1), Virginia (109), West Virginia (7), and Wisconsin (3).\n\n\n129 of these cases reported eating a smoothie from Tropical Smoothie Caf\u00e9. There have been no cases reporting illness from this same exposure since September 23, 2016.\n\n14 cases had no direct exposure to Tropical smoothie caf\u00e9. The latest illness onset date among these cases was October 25, 2016.\n56 ill people were hospitalized. No deaths were reported.\n\n\nFDA traceback information indicated that the frozen strawberries served in the Tropical Smoothie Caf\u00e9 locations were from the International Company for Agricultural Production & Processing (ICAPP), imported from Egypt. On August 8, 2016, Tropical Smoothie Caf\u00e9 reported that they removed the Egyptian frozen strawberries from their restaurants in Maryland, North Carolina, Virginia, and West Virginia and switched to another supplier out of an abundance of caution. Information available at this time does not indicate an ongoing risk of hepatitis A virus infection at Tropical Smoothie Cafes.\nOn October 30, 2016, the International Company for Agricultural Production & Processing (ICAPP) recalled\u00a0all of its frozen strawberries that were imported into the U.S. since January 1, 2016. The recalled products were distributed for sale to and use in food service establishments nationwide.\n\nThe FDA reports that hepatitis A virus contamination was found in multiple samples of ICAPP frozen strawberries.\n\n\nThis investigation is considered complete.\n\n\n\n\nInitial Announcement - September 1, 2016\n\n\n\nTextbox module not selected or not found.\n\n\nFrozen Strawberry Recall\nOn October 30, 2016, ICAPP announced that it had notified its distributors that frozen strawberries were being recalled due to a potential contamination with hepatitis A.\u00a0\nICAPP Distributors are required to notify facilities/retailers that have received the frozen strawberries\n\nRecalled products were distributed for sale to and use in in facilities (nursing homes, schools, etc) \u00a0nationwide.\nNotification is ongoing.\n\n\nFacilities and retailers should not sell or serve recalled frozen strawberries.\n\n\n\nAdvice to Facilities who have received notification from ICAPP Distributors\nIf the facility has served any of the recalled frozen strawberries in the last 2 weeks since the notification , contact their local health department for further instructions and consideration of post exposure prophylaxis (PEP)\nIf the facility has received any of the recalled frozen strawberries but has not served them to anyone, any remaining product should be discarded and no further action is needed.\n\n\nAdvice to Public Health Officials\n\nBecause hepatitis A can have serious health consequences, CDC recommends providing post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for unvaccinated people who have eaten recalled strawberries in the last 2 weeks. PEP consists of:\n\nHepatitis A vaccine for people between the ages of 1 and 40 years\nHepatitis A virus-specific immunoglobulin (IG) for people outside of this age range. If immunoglobulin is not available, hepatitis A vaccine can be substituted\nThose with evidence of previous vaccination do not require PEP\n\n\n\nNOTE: CDC recommends that all children be vaccinated against hepatitis A at age 1.\u00a0 Any parent or caregiver who is unsure if a child has been vaccinated should consult their health care provider and confirm vaccination status.\n\nAdvice to ConsumersInformation available at this time does not indicate an ongoing risk of hepatitis A virus infection at Tropical Smoothie Cafes.\n\nIt is possible that you might be contacted by an institution (i.e., school, nursing home) and told that you or a family member was exposed to recalled frozen strawberries.\u00a0 \n\nIf you are unsure if you have been vaccinated against hepatitis A, contact your health professional to check your immunization records.\u00a0 If you have been vaccinated, no further action is needed.\u00a0 If you have never received the hepatitis A vaccine, getting a single dose within two weeks of exposure can protect against illness.\u00a0 Because hepatitis A can have serious health consequences, CDC recommends post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for unvaccinated people who have eaten recalled strawberries in the last 2 weeks. PEP consists of:\n\nHepatitis A vaccine for people between the ages of 1 and 40 years\nHepatitis A virus-specific immunoglobulin (IG) for people outside of this age range, but the hepatitis A vaccine can be substituted if IG is not available.\nThose with evidence of previous vaccination do not require PEP\n\n\n\nSymptoms can occur anywhere from 15 to 50 days after exposure, but not everyone will experience symptoms from a hepatitis A virus infection. Some people may experience mild flu-like symptoms. Other symptoms of hepatitis A virus infection include:\n\nYellow eyes or skin\nAbdominal pain\nPale stools\nDark urine\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Hepatitis A PreventionCases of hepatitis A have decreased dramatically over the last decade in large part due to successful vaccination programs and policies. Most new cases of hepatitis A are now related to international travel, and occasional foodborne outbreaks. Once a person becomes ill from hepatitis A, the virus can be easily transmitted to household or sexual partners. Thorough hand washing can help minimize transmission among close contacts.\nThe hepatitis A vaccine is recommended as part of routine childhood vaccinations and for adults at high risk. CDC recommends the following groups be vaccinated against hepatitis A:\n\nAll children at age 1 year\nTravelers to countries that have high rates of hepatitis A\nFamily members and caregivers of recent adoptees from countries where hepatitis A is common\nMen who have sexual contact with other men\nUsers of injection and non-injection illegal drugs\nPeople with chronic liver disease\nPeople who are treated with clotting-factor concentrates\nPeople who work with hepatitis A infected animals or in a hepatitis A research laboratory\n\n\n\n\nAt a Glance\nCase Count: 143\nStates: 9\nDeaths: 0\nHospitalizations: 56\nRecall: Yes\n\n\nLatest Case Count Map\nClick map to view case count map and table.\n\nMore Information\nVirginia Department of Health Hepatitis A Investigationexternal icon\nFDA Investigates Outbreak of Hepatitis A Illnesses Linked to Frozen Strawberriesexternal icon\nCDC Hepatitis A Questions and Answers for the Public\nCDC Hepatitis A Questions and Answers for Health Professionals", "reports": [{"diseases": ["hepatitis a"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "2016-1-1 xx:xx:xx", "locations": [{"geonames_id": 4801859}, {"geonames_id": 5128581}, {"geonames_id": 4099753}, {"geonames_id": 357994}, {"geonames_id": 4563243}, {"geonames_id": 5279468}, {"geonames_id": 6255150}, {"geonames_id": 5744337}, {"geonames_id": 4361885}, {"geonames_id": 11071615}]}]},

The hepatitis A virus is found in the stool and blood of people who are infected. The hepatitis A virus is spread when someone ingests the virus, usually through close personal contact with an infected person or from eating contaminated food or drink. Hepatitis A can be prevented with a vaccine, which is recommended for all children at age one and adults at risk.\nSymptoms of Hepatitis A\n\n\nSymptoms of hepatitis A usually appear 2 to 7 weeks after exposure and can include\n\nYellow skin or eyes\nNot wanting to eat\nUpset stomach\nStomach pain\nThrowing up\nFever\nDark urine or light-colored stools\nJoint pain\nDiarrhea\nFeeling tired\n\n\nNot everyone with hepatitis A has symptoms. Adults are more likely to have symptoms than children.\nPeople who get hepatitis A may feel sick for a few weeks to several months but usually recover completely and do not have lasting liver damage. In some people, though, the illness may be so severe that the patient needs to be hospitalized.\nIn rare cases, hepatitis A can cause liver failure and even death. This is more common in older people and in people with other serious health issues, such as chronic liver disease.\n\nFinal Investigation DetailsFebruary 19, 2020\nCDC, public health and regulatory officials in several states, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)external icon investigated a multistate outbreak of hepatitis A associated with exposure to contaminated fresh blackberries sold at Fresh Thyme Farmers Market and Woodman\u2019s grocery stores during September 2019.\nAs of February 19, 2020, a total of 20 outbreak-associated cases of hepatitis A were reported from 7 states. A list of the states and the number of cases in each is found on the Map of Reported Cases page.\nIllnesses started on dates ranging from October 8, 2019, to November 15, 2019. Ill people ranged in age from 14 to 73 years, with a median age of 50. Sixty percent of ill people were female. Of 19 people with available information, 11 (58%) were hospitalized. No deaths were reported.\nInvestigation of the Outbreak\nEpidemiologic and traceback evidence indicated that fresh blackberries were the likely source of this outbreak.\nIn interviews, ill people answered questions about the foods they ate and other exposures\u00a0in the 2 to 7 weeks before they became ill. Of people who were interviewed, 19/20 (95%) reported eating fresh blackberries; of 17 people with known fresh blackberry purchase location information, 16/17 (94%) purchased fresh blackberries from either Fresh Thyme Farmers Market or Woodman\u2019s Market. This proportion was significantly higher than results from a survey pdf icon[PDF \u2013 29 pages]\u00a0of healthy people in which 7% reported eating fresh blackberries in the week before they were interviewed.\nFDA completed its traceback investigation; however, a single, common source of fresh, conventional blackberries could not be identified.\nAs of February 19, 2020, this outbreak investigation is over.\nKey Resources\n\nCDC Hepatitis A Fact Sheet pdf icon[PDF \u2013 2 pages]\nCDC hepatitis A Q&A for the public\nCDC Postexposure Prophylaxis for Hepatitis A\nHow to Report a Foodborne Illness\nCDC\u2019s Food Safety Information", "reports": [{"diseases": ["hepatitis a"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "2019-11-19 xx:xx:xx to 2019-11-15 xx:xx:xx", "locations": [{"geonames_id": 4887398}, {"geonames_id": 5001836}, {"geonames_id": 5279468}, {"geonames_id": 5073708}, {"geonames_id": 12213487}, {"geonames_id": 5037779}, {"geonames_id": 12213626}, {"geonames_id": 12217084}]}]},

Hepatitis A is a contagious liver disease that results from infection with the hepatitis A virus. \u00a0It can range in severity from a mild illness lasting a few weeks to a severe illness lasting several months. \u00a0Although rare, people have died from infection with hepatitis A. Symptoms appear between 15 and 50 days after infection and can include yellow eyes or skin, abdominal pain, or pale stools.\nEpidemiologic and traceback evidence indicate frozen strawberries imported from Egypt were the likely source of this outbreak.\n\nIn interviews, nearly all ill people interviewed reported drinking smoothies containing strawberries at Tropical Smoothie Caf\u00e9 locations prior to August 8 in a limited geographical area, including Maryland, North Carolina, Virginia, and West Virginia, but there have been a small number of cases outside of that geographic area with no Tropical Smoothie Caf\u00e9 exposure.\n\n\nInformation available at this time does not indicate an ongoing risk of acquiring hepatitis A virus infection at Tropical Smoothie Caf\u00e9\u2019s, as the contaminated food product has been removed as of August 8.

The hepatitis A virus is found in the stool and blood of people who are infected. The hepatitis A virus is spread when someone ingests the virus, usually through close personal contact with an infected person or from eating contaminated food or drink. Hepatitis A can be prevented with a vaccine, which is recommended for all children at age one and adults at risk.\nSymptoms of Hepatitis A\n\n\nSymptoms of hepatitis A usually appear 2 to 7 weeks after exposure and can include\n\nYellow skin or eyes\nNot wanting to eat\nUpset stomach\nStomach pain\nThrowing up\nFever\nDark urine or light-colored stools\nJoint pain\nDiarrhea\nFeeling tired\n\n\nNot everyone with hepatitis A has symptoms. Adults are more likely to have symptoms than children.\nPeople who get hepatitis A may feel sick for a few weeks to several months but usually recover completely and do not have lasting liver damage. In some people, though, the illness may be so severe that the patient needs to be hospitalized.\nIn rare cases, hepatitis A can cause liver failure and even death. This is more common in older people and in people with other serious health issues, such as chronic liver disease.\n\nFinal Investigation DetailsFebruary 19, 2020\nCDC, public health and regulatory officials in several states, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)external icon investigated a multistate outbreak of hepatitis A associated with exposure to contaminated fresh blackberries sold at Fresh Thyme Farmers Market and Woodman\u2019s grocery stores during September 2019.\nAs of February 19, 2020, a total of 20 outbreak-associated cases of hepatitis A were reported from 7 states. A list of the states and the number of cases in each is found on the Map of Reported Cases page.\nIllnesses started on dates ranging from October 8, 2019, to November 15, 2019. Ill people ranged in age from 14 to 73 years, with a median age of 50. Sixty percent of ill people were female. Of 19 people with available information, 11 (58%) were hospitalized. No deaths were reported.\nInvestigation of the Outbreak\nEpidemiologic and traceback evidence indicated that fresh blackberries were the likely source of this outbreak.\nIn interviews, ill people answered questions about the foods they ate and other exposures\u00a0in the 2 to 7 weeks before they became ill. Of people who were interviewed, 19/20 (95%) reported eating fresh blackberries; of 17 people with known fresh blackberry purchase location information, 16/17 (94%) purchased fresh blackberries from either Fresh Thyme Farmers Market or Woodman\u2019s Market. This proportion was significantly higher than results from a survey pdf icon[PDF \u2013 29 pages]\u00a0of healthy people in which 7% reported eating fresh blackberries in the week before they were interviewed.\nFDA completed its traceback investigation; however, a single, common source of fresh, conventional blackberries could not be identified.\nAs of February 19, 2020, this outbreak investigation is over.\nKey Resources\n\nCDC Hepatitis A Fact Sheet pdf icon[PDF \u2013 2 pages]\nCDC hepatitis A Q&A for the public\nCDC Postexposure Prophylaxis for Hepatitis A\nHow to Report a Foodborne Illness\nCDC\u2019s Food Safety Information", "reports": [{"diseases": ["hepatitis a"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "2019-11-19 xx:xx:xx to 2019-11-15 xx:xx:xx", "locations": [{"geonames_id": 4887398}, {"geonames_id": 5001836}, {"geonames_id": 5279468}, {"geonames_id": 4921868}, {"geonames_id": 5073708}, {"geonames_id": 5037779}, {"geonames_id": 12213626}, {"geonames_id": 4560349}]}]},

Hepatitis A is a contagious liver disease that results from infection with the hepatitis A virus. \u00a0It can range in severity from a mild illness lasting a few weeks to a severe illness lasting several months. \u00a0Although rare, people have died from infection with hepatitis A. Symptoms appear between 15 and 50 days after infection and can include yellow eyes or skin, abdominal pain, or pale stools.\nEpidemiologic and traceback evidence indicate frozen strawberries imported from Egypt were the likely source of this outbreak.\n\nIn interviews, nearly all ill people interviewed reported drinking smoothies containing strawberries at Tropical Smoothie Caf\u00e9 locations prior to August 8 in a limited geographical area, including Maryland, North Carolina, Virginia, and West Virginia, but there have been a small number of cases outside of that geographic area with no Tropical Smoothie Caf\u00e9 exposure.\n\n\nInformation available at this time does not indicate an ongoing risk of acquiring hepatitis A virus infection at Tropical Smoothie Caf\u00e9\u2019s, as the contaminated food product has been removed as of August 8.

If you froze them to eat later, do not eat them.\nThrow away any remaining blackberries.\nIf you have eaten these blackberries, purchased fresh and later frozen, within the last 14 days and are not vaccinated against hepatitis A, contact your local health department or healthcare provider to discuss getting postexposure prophylaxis (hepatitis A vaccine or immune globulin).

The hepatitis A virus is found in the stool and blood of people who are infected. The hepatitis A virus is spread when someone ingests the virus, usually through close personal contact with an infected person or from eating contaminated food or drink. Hepatitis A can be prevented with a vaccine, which is recommended for all children at age one and adults at risk.\nSymptoms of Hepatitis A\n\n\nSymptoms of hepatitis A usually appear 2 to 7 weeks after exposure and can include\n\nYellow skin or eyes\nNot wanting to eat\nUpset stomach\nStomach pain\nThrowing up\nFever\nDark urine or light-colored stools\nJoint pain\nDiarrhea\nFeeling tired\n\n\nNot everyone with hepatitis A has symptoms. Adults are more likely to have symptoms than children.\nPeople who get hepatitis A may feel sick for a few weeks to several months but usually recover completely and do not have lasting liver damage. In some people, though, the illness may be so severe that the patient needs to be hospitalized.\nIn rare cases, hepatitis A can cause liver failure and even death. This is more common in older people and in people with other serious health issues, such as chronic liver disease.\n\nFinal Investigation DetailsFebruary 19, 2020\nCDC, public health and regulatory officials in several states, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)external icon investigated a multistate outbreak of hepatitis A associated with exposure to contaminated fresh blackberries sold at Fresh Thyme Farmers Market and Woodman\u2019s grocery stores during September 2019.\nAs of February 19, 2020, a total of 20 outbreak-associated cases of hepatitis A were reported from 7 states. A list of the states and the number of cases in each is found on the Map of Reported Cases page.\nIllnesses started on dates ranging from October 8, 2019, to November 15, 2019. Ill people ranged in age from 14 to 73 years, with a median age of 50. Sixty percent of ill people were female. Of 19 people with available information, 11 (58%) were hospitalized. No deaths were reported.\nInvestigation of the Outbreak\nEpidemiologic and traceback evidence indicated that fresh blackberries were the likely source of this outbreak.\nIn interviews, ill people answered questions about the foods they ate and other exposures\u00a0in the 2 to 7 weeks before they became ill. Of people who were interviewed, 19/20 (95%) reported eating fresh blackberries; of 17 people with known fresh blackberry purchase location information, 16/17 (94%) purchased fresh blackberries from either Fresh Thyme Farmers Market or Woodman\u2019s Market. This proportion was significantly higher than results from a survey pdf icon[PDF \u2013 29 pages]\u00a0of healthy people in which 7% reported eating fresh blackberries in the week before they were interviewed.\nFDA completed its traceback investigation; however, a single, common source of fresh, conventional blackberries could not be identified.\nAs of February 19, 2020, this outbreak investigation is over.\nKey Resources\n\nCDC Hepatitis A Fact Sheet pdf icon[PDF \u2013 2 pages]\nCDC hepatitis A Q&A for the public\nCDC Postexposure Prophylaxis for Hepatitis A\nHow to Report a Foodborne Illness\nCDC\u2019s Food Safety Information", "reports": [{"diseases": ["hepatitis a"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "2019-11-19 xx:xx:xx to 2019-11-15 xx:xx:xx", "locations": [{"geonames_id": 4887398}, {"geonames_id": 5001836}, {"geonames_id": 5279468}, {"geonames_id": 5073708}, {"geonames_id": 12213487}, {"geonames_id": 5037779}, {"geonames_id": 12213626}, {"geonames_id": 12217084}]}]},

Hepatitis A is a contagious liver disease that results from infection with the hepatitis A virus. \u00a0It can range in severity from a mild illness lasting a few weeks to a severe illness lasting several months. \u00a0Although rare, people have died from infection with hepatitis A. Symptoms appear between 15 and 50 days after infection and can include yellow eyes or skin, abdominal pain, or pale stools.\nEpidemiologic and traceback evidence indicate frozen strawberries imported from Egypt were the likely source of this outbreak.\n\nIn interviews, nearly all ill people interviewed reported drinking smoothies containing strawberries at Tropical Smoothie Caf\u00e9 locations prior to August 8 in a limited geographical area, including Maryland, North Carolina, Virginia, and West Virginia, but there have been a small number of cases outside of that geographic area with no Tropical Smoothie Caf\u00e9 exposure.\n\n\nInformation available at this time does not indicate an ongoing risk of acquiring hepatitis A virus infection at Tropical Smoothie Caf\u00e9\u2019s, as the contaminated food product has been removed as of August 8. As of December 13, 2016:\n\n143 people with hepatitis A have been reported from nine states: Arkansas (1), California (1), Maryland (12), New York (5), North Carolina (4), Oregon (1), Virginia (109), West Virginia (7), and Wisconsin (3).\n\n\n129 of these cases reported eating a smoothie from Tropical Smoothie Caf\u00e9.

The latest illness onset date among these cases was October 25, 2016.\n56 ill people were hospitalized. No deaths were reported.\n\n\nFDA traceback information indicated that the frozen strawberries served in the Tropical Smoothie Caf\u00e9 locations were from the International Company for Agricultural Production & Processing (ICAPP), imported from Egypt. On August 8, 2016, Tropical Smoothie Caf\u00e9 reported that they removed the Egyptian frozen strawberries from their restaurants in Maryland, North Carolina, Virginia, and West Virginia and switched to another supplier out of an abundance of caution. Information available at this time does not indicate an ongoing risk of hepatitis A virus infection at Tropical Smoothie Cafes.\nOn October 30, 2016, the International Company for Agricultural Production & Processing (ICAPP) recalled\u00a0all of its frozen strawberries that were imported into the U.S. since January 1, 2016.

PEP consists of:\n\nHepatitis A vaccine for people between the ages of 1 and 40 years\nHepatitis A virus-specific immunoglobulin (IG) for people outside of this age range. If immunoglobulin is not available, hepatitis A vaccine can be substituted\nThose with evidence of previous vaccination do not require PEP\n\n\n\nNOTE: CDC recommends that all children be vaccinated against hepatitis A at age 1.\u00a0 Any parent or caregiver who is unsure if a child has been vaccinated should consult their health care provider and confirm vaccination status.\n\nAdvice to ConsumersInformation available at this time does not indicate an ongoing risk of hepatitis A virus infection at Tropical Smoothie Cafes.\n\nIt is possible that you might be contacted by an institution (i.e., school, nursing home) and told that you or a family member was exposed to recalled frozen strawberries.\u00a0 \n\nIf you are unsure if you have been vaccinated against hepatitis A, contact your health professional to check your immunization records.\u00a0 If you have been vaccinated, no further action is needed.\u00a0 If you have never received the hepatitis A vaccine, getting a single dose within two weeks of exposure can protect against illness.\u00a0 Because hepatitis A can have serious health consequences, CDC recommends post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for unvaccinated people who have eaten recalled strawberries in the last 2 weeks.

Most new cases of hepatitis A are now related to international travel, and occasional foodborne outbreaks. Once a person becomes ill from hepatitis A, the virus can be easily transmitted to household or sexual partners. Thorough hand washing can help minimize transmission among close contacts.\nThe hepatitis A vaccine is recommended as part of routine childhood vaccinations and for adults at high risk.

[Note: The cases reported from Wisconsin resulted from exposure to the product in California, the cases reported from New Hampshire reported fruit exposure during travel to Nevada, and the case reported in New Jersey was a household contact of a confirmed case from Colorado.] Eight of the confirmed cases were household contacts of confirmed cases (secondary cases). One person was exposed to the same pomegranate arils in a different product, \u2018Woodstock Frozen Organic Pomegranate Kernels.\u2019\n\n90 (55%) ill people were women\nAges ranged from 1 \u2013 84 years;\n\n94 (58%) of those ill were between 40 \u2013 64 years of age.\n11 children age 18 or under were also ill. None were previously vaccinated.\n\n\nIllness onset dates ranged from 3/31/2013 \u2013 7/26/2013\n71 (44%) ill people were hospitalized, and no deaths were reported\nAll ill people who reported eating this product purchased it from Costco markets; however, the product was also sold at Harris Teeter stores. No ill people were identified that bought the product at Harris Teeter.\n\n\n\nLaboratory Investigation:\n\n\nThe major outbreak strain of hepatitis A virus, belonging to genotype 1B, was found in clinical specimens of 117 people in nine states: AZ, CA, CO, HI, NH, NJ, NM, NV, and WI. This genotype is rarely seen in the Americas but circulates in North Africa and the Middle East.\nThis genotype was identified in a 2013 outbreak of hepatitis A virus infections in Europe linked to frozen berries and a 2012 outbreak in British Columbia related to a frozen berry blend with pomegranate seeds from Egypt. However, there is no evidence at this time that these outbreaks are related to the ongoing U. S. outbreak.\n\n\nRegulatory Investigation:\n\nBy combining information gained from FDA\u2019s traceback and traceforward investigations and the CDC\u2019s epidemiological investigation, FDA and CDC have determined that the most likely vehicle for the hepatitis A virus appears to be a common shipment of pomegranate seeds from a company in Turkey, Goknur Foodstuffs Import Export Trading.\n\nFDA detained shipments of pomegranate seeds from Goknur when they are offered for import into the United States.\nThese pomegranate seeds were used by Townsend Farms to make the Townsend Farms and Harris Teeter Organic Antioxidant Blends and by Scenic Fruit Company to make the Woodstock Frozen Organic Pomegranate Kernels.\nFDA worked with the firms that have distributed pomegranate seeds from this shipment from Turkey to help ensure that all recipients of these seeds were notified.\n\n\nOn June 4, 2013, Townsend Farms, Inc. of Fairview, Oregon voluntarily recalled certain lots of its frozen Organic Antioxidant Blend\u00a0because of potential hepatitis A virus contamination.\n\nOn June 28, 2013, Townsend Farms, Inc. of Fairview, Oregon, expanded its voluntary limited lot recall of frozen Organic Antioxidant Blend, 3 lb. because of potential hepatitis A virus contamination.\n\n\nOn June 26, 2013, Scenic Fruit Company of Gresham, Oregon recalled specific lots of Woodstock Frozen Organic Pomegranate Kernels\u00a0because of potential hepatitis A virus contamination.\nAdditional information regarding these recalls was updated regularly at: FDA Investigates Multistate Outbreak of Hepatitis A Illnesses Associated with Pomegranate seeds from Turkish Importerexternal icon.\nConsumers should not eat recalled products containing pomegranate seeds.
