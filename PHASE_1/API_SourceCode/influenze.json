While CDC conducts annual education and awareness campaigns with the goal of increasing flu vaccination, this season, extra work has been done in this area, including the launch of a new campaign called: No One Has Time for Flu.\nThe campaign is the result of a collaborationpdf iconexternal icon between The Ad Council, the American Medical Association (AMA), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the CDC Foundation, which along with AMA provided campaign funding. The campaign aims to increase vaccine uptake overall, but puts a particular emphasis on reaching African American and Hispanic/LatinX communities, populations that can be \u00a0disproportionately affected by flu illness and serious flu complications, but are less likely to be vaccinated.\nCampaign public service announcements (PSAs) presented by the Ad Council run on space donated by TV stations, media outlets, and social media platforms. Many campaign assets, including television public service announcements, are available for viewing and sharing at http://getmyflushot.adcouncilkit.org/external icon.\nIn preparation for the campaign, the Ad Council arranged for quantitative research surveys to be fielded, to help understand behaviors and attitudes towards flu vaccines in 2020 among African American and Hispanic uncommitted consumers, defined as people who had not yet decided to get vaccinated this season.\n\nSurvey findings showed that 52% of Hispanic adults and 43% of African American adults said they are likely to get a flu shot in 2020. This compares to 63% among White adults.\nNearly 40% of both African American and Hispanic respondents remain uncommitted, which compares to just 24% of whites. Research suggests inertia is a big factor in why African Americans and Hispanics do not get a flu vaccine. The top reason given for not getting vaccinated was \u201cI never get the flu shot/not something I do.\u201d\nThe Ad Council partnered with fluent360, a creative agency based in Chicago, to develop the creative concept and materials for the No One Has Time for Flu campaign. The PSAs highlight the different circumstances many people are experiencing as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the fact that, now, more than ever, no one has time to be sick with flu.

Participants, including director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health Dr. Anthony Fauci, urged the public and health care professionals to follow the CDC recommendation that everyone 6 months and older get vaccinated against flu annually\nRoll Your #SleeveUp to Fight Flu!\nEncourage your followers on social media to roll up their sleeves for an annual flu vaccine by featuring photos of yourself and others in your community getting a flu vaccine or showing off a bandage after getting a flu vaccine.\n#SleeveUp\nCDC also released multiple reports on the 2019-2020 flu season today, including influenza vaccination coverage estimates among the U.S. public, health care providers and pregnant women. The agency also released updated preliminary estimates on the burden of flu last season, and for the first time, estimates for the burden of flu averted by vaccination last season.\nDuring 2019-2020, CDC estimates there were 38 million flu illnesses, 18 million flu-associated medical visits, 400,000 flu hospitalizations and 22,000 flu-associated deaths. These numbers are lower than the in-season burden estimates\u00a0provided last season, because they were calculated using more recently available data on flu testing practices in patients hospitalized with flu, which is a key input in the model CDC uses to generate these estimates. Influenza testing has increased in recent years, which can cause preliminary burden estimates to change. An example is the preliminary burden estimates made for the 2017-2018 season, when an initial estimate of 79,000 deaths, was later updated to 61,000. The CDC website has more information on how CDC estimates flu burden.\nCDC also provided new estimates on the burden of flu averted by vaccination last season. CDC estimates that flu vaccination prevented 7.5 million flu illnesses, 3.7 million flu medical visits, 105,000 flu hospitalizations and 6,300 flu deaths. These estimates are based on vaccine effectiveness estimates from 2019-2020, as well as data on vaccine coverage during last flu season which were also released by CDC today.\nCDC\u2019s influenza vaccination coverage reports show that overall flu vaccination coverage (among people 6 months and older) during 2019-2020 increased from the previous season to nearly 52%. This is the highest flu vaccine coverage for this age group recorded since CDC recommended universal influenza vaccination of all persons 6 months and older in 2010. However, this figure also means that nearly half of U.S. residents did not get vaccinated. While flu vaccination increased overall for both children and adults, coverage did not increase among certain racial and ethnic groups. Black children have lower flu vaccination coverage than children of all other racial/ethnic groups. Hispanic adults and black adults continue to have lower flu vaccination coverage than white adults. Additionally, only 44% of people with chronic conditions were vaccinated against flu last season. And while flu vaccination coverage among pregnant women increased from 54% to 61% that still leaves a significant number of pregnant women and their babies unprotected from flu. Pregnant women and people with certain chronic conditions are among those at higher risk for flu complications, so it is especially important for them to be vaccinated against flu annually. Lastly, CDC\u2019s flu vaccination coverage estimates for health care workers show that 81% were vaccinated against flu last season. Coverage was highest among physicians (98%) and lowest among aides and assistants (72%).\nCDC has emphasized the added importance of getting a flu vaccine during the 2020-2021 flu season because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. While it is unclear how the pandemic will affect the flu season, CDC is preparing for COVID-19 and seasonal flu to spread at the same time. Co-circulation could place a tremendous burden on our health care system and result in many illnesses, hospitalizations and deaths. Getting a flu vaccine is something easy people can do to protect themselves and their loved ones and to help reduce the spread of flu this fall and winter. Flu vaccine will not protect against COVID-19. But vaccination has many other benefits and is part of a comprehensive public health strategy to reduce the burden of flu, which can flatten the curve of respiratory illnesses overall, help protect essential workers from flu, and preserve medical resources for care of patients with COVID-19. October is a good time to get vaccinated, but as long as flu viruses are circulating, vaccination can continue\u2014even in January or later. The more people who are vaccinated against flu; the more people are protected from flu.\nNow More Than Ever\nCDC recommends everyone 6 months and older be vaccinated against flu. It protects the person getting vaccinated and the people around them. Flu vaccines have been shown to prevent flu illness and reduce the risk of hospitalizations and deaths. Flu vaccination is proven to help protect pregnant women and people with chronic health conditions while reducing the burden of flu on our communities and health care system. This year, especially, it will be most important to protect those at higher risk for flu complications. Many of these people are also at high risk for COVID-19 illness or serious outcomes. It is also important for caregivers and essential workers to protect themselves and those around them from flu by getting a flu vaccine.\nVaccine and Administration\nManufacturers estimate between 194 and 198 million doses of flu vaccine will be available this season. Approximately 99% of the flu vaccines will be quadrivalent. COVID-19 activity may affect when, where and how flu vaccines will be given. CDC has provided interim guidance for vaccination to help immunization providers ensure safe administration of vaccines during the pandemic. So far, nearly 90 million doses of flu vaccine have been distributed in the United States.\nVaccination Coverage\n\nFlu Vaccination Coverage, United States, 2019-20 Influenza Season\nFlu Vaccination Coverage Among Pregnant Women \u2013 United States, 2019-20 Flu Season\nInfluenza Vaccination Coverage Among Health Care Personnel \u2014 United States, 2020\u201321 Influenza Season\n\n2019-2020 Influenza Season Estimates\n\nEstimated Influenza Illnesses, Medical visits, Hospitalizations, and Deaths in the United States \u2014 2019\u20132020 influenza season\u200b\u200b\nEstimated Influenza Illnesses, Medical visits, and Hospitalizations Averted by Vaccination in the United States \u2014 2019\u20132020 Influenza Season\u200b\n\n2020- 2021 Flu Season Updates\n\n2020 NFID Influenza/Pneumococcal News Conferenceexternal icon\n2020-2021 Flu Season Information\nCDC\u2019s 2020-2021 Seasonal Flu Vaccination Campaign Digital Toolkit\n\nHealth Care Provider Resources\n\nPrevention and Control of Seasonal Influenza with Vaccines: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices \u2014 United States, 2020\u201321 Influenza Season\nCDC Updates for Health Care Providers about the 2020-2021 Flu Season\nResources to help health care professionals make a strong flu vaccine recommendation\n\n\nFull Infographicimage icon \u200b\nEstimated Influenza Illnesses, Medical visits, and Hospitalizations Averted by Vaccination in the United States \u2014 2019\u20132020 Influenza Season\u200b", "reports": [{"diseases": ["COVID-19"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "2010-03-23 00:00:00", "locations": [6255150]}]}{"url": "https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/2019-2020.html", "date_of_publication": "", "headline": "Estimated Influenza Illnesses, Medical visits, Hospitalizations, and Deaths in the United States \u2014 2019\u20132020 Influenza Seaso", "main_text": "Estimated Influenza Illnesses, Medical visits, Hospitalizations, and Deaths in the United States \u2014 2019\u20132020 Influenza Season   \n\n\nOn This Page\n\nIntroduction 2019\u20132020 Burden EstimatesConclusionBurden Estimates Limitations Flu Burden InfographicReferences \n\nIntroduction\nThis web page provides estimates on the burden of influenza (flu) in the United States for the 2019\u20132020 flu season. For the past several years, CDC has used a mathematical model to estimate the numbers of influenza illnesses, medical visits, hospitalizations, and deaths (1-4). The methods used to calculate the estimates have been described previously (1-2). CDC uses the estimates of the burden of flu in the population to inform policy and communications related to influenza prevention and control.\nBenefits of Flu Vaccination for the 2019-2020 SeasonCDC estimates the influenza illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths prevented by seasonal influenza vaccination.\nMore2019\u20132020 Burden Estimates\nInfluenza activity in the United States during the 2019\u20132020 season began to increase in November and was consistently high through January and February.\u00a0 The season was characterized by two consecutive waves of activity, beginning with influenza B viruses and followed by A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses. Overall, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were the most commonly reported influenza viruses this season. Activity began to decline in March, perhaps associated with community prevention measures for COVID-19 (5-6). The 2019-20 season is described as having moderate severity; however, the effect of influenza differed by age group and the severity of the season in some age groups was higher. Hospitalization rates among children 0-4 years old and adults 18-49 years old were higher than observed during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic (6).\nCDC estimates that the burden of illness during the 2019\u20132020 season was moderate with an estimated 38 million people sick with flu, 18 million visits to a health care provider for flu, 400,000 hospitalizations for flu, and 22,000 flu deaths \u00a0(Table 1). The number of cases of influenza-associated illness, medically attended illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths were lower than some more recent seasons and similar to other seasons where influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses dominated (7, 8).\nThe 2019\u20132020 influenza season was atypical in that it was severe for children aged 0-4 years and adults 18-49 years where rates of infections, medically attended illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths were higher than those observed during the 2017-2018 season, a recent season with high severity (7). The burden of influenza and the rates of influenza-associated hospitalization are usually higher for the very young and the very old, and while this was observed during the 2019\u20132020 season, rates of hospitalization in adults aged 18-49 years were the highest seasonal rates seen since the 2017-2018 season (Table 2). These rates mean that an estimated 15 million cases of influenza in younger adults (aged 18-49 years), which is the highest number of infections for this age group since CDC began reporting influenza burden estimates in the 2010-11 season.\nCDC\u2019s estimates of hospitalizations and mortality associated with the 2019\u20132020 influenza season show the effects that influenza virus infections can have on society. More than 52,000 hospitalizations occurred in children aged < 18 years and 86,000 hospitalizations among adults aged 18-49 years. Forty-three percent of hospitalizations occurred in older adults aged \u226565 years. Older adults also accounted for 62% of deaths, which is lower than recent previous seasons.\u00a0 These findings continue to highlight that older adults are particularly vulnerable to severe disease with influenza virus infection. An estimated 7,800 deaths (36% of all deaths) occurred among working age adults (aged 18\u201364 years), an age group for which influenza vaccine coverage is often low (9). This also underscores that influenza viruses can affect individuals of any age and prevention measures such as vaccination are important to reducing the impact of the seasonal epidemics on the population and healthcare system.\nDeaths in children with laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infection have been a reportable disease in the United States since 2004; 188 deaths were reported for the 2019-20 season as of September 19, 2020. However, influenza-associated pediatric deaths are likely under-reported, as not all children whose death was related to an influenza virus infection may have been tested for flu (10,11). Therefore, we used a mathematical model to estimate the total number of pediatric deaths based on hospitalization rates and the frequency of death in and out of the hospital using death certificates. We estimate that at least 434 deaths associated with influenza occurred during the 2019-2020 season among children aged <18 years.\nConclusion\nDuring the 2019-2020 influenza season, CDC estimates that influenza was associated with 38 million illnesses, 18 million medical visits, 405,000 hospitalizations, and 22,000 deaths. The influenza burden was higher in young children (0-4 years) and adults (18-49 years) compared with a recent season with the 2017-2018 season, a recent season with high severity, and provides evidence to support how severe seasonal influenza can be at any age.\nBurden Estimates Limitations\nThese estimates are subject to several limitations.\nFirst, rates of influenza-associated hospitalizations are based on data reported to the Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv\u2013NET) through September 2, 2020. Final case counts may differ slightly as further data cleaning from the 2019-2020 season are conducted by FluSurv\u2013NET sites. The most updated crude rates of hospitalization for FluSurv-NET sites are available on FluView Interactive (6).\nSecond, national rates of influenza-associated hospitalizations and in-hospital death were adjusted for the frequency of influenza testing and the sensitivity of influenza diagnostic assays, using a multiplier approach (3). However, data on testing practices during the 2019\u20132020 season were not available at the time of estimation. We adjusted rates using the lowest multiplier from any season between 2010\u20132011 and 2017\u20132018. Burden estimates from the 2019\u20132020 season will be updated at a later date when data on contemporary testing practices become available.\nThird, estimates of influenza-associated illness are made by multiplying the number of hospitalizations by the ratio of illnesses to hospitalizations; estimates of medical visits are made by a similar process.\u00a0 These multipliers are based on data from a prior season, which may not be accurate if patterns of care-seeking have changed.\nFourth, our estimate of influenza-associated deaths relies on information about location of death from death certificates to calculate ratios of deaths occurring in the hospital to deaths occurring outside of the hospital by categories of causes of death. \u00a0However, death certificate data during the 2019\u20132020 season were not available at the time of estimation. We used death certification data from all influenza seasons from 2010\u20132011 through 2017\u20132018 where these data were available from the National Center for Health Statistics. To calculate these ratios, first we calculate the frequency of flu-related deaths reported from our FluSurv-NET surveillance system that have cause of death identified as pneumonia or influenza (P&I), other respiratory or cardiovascular (other R&C), or other non-respiratory, non-cardiovascular (non-R&C).\u00a0 Next, to account for deaths occurring outside of a hospital, we use information from national death certificates to calculate the proportion of deaths from these causes that occur in and out of the hospital. Data to generate these frequencies were not available from the 2019\u20132020 season at the time of estimation, so we used the average frequencies of location of death for each of the cause categories from previous seasons, 2010\u20132011 through 2017\u20132018.\nFifth, estimates of burden were derived from rates of influenza-associated hospitalization, which is a different approach than the statistical models used in older published reports. This makes it difficult to directly compare our estimates for seasons since 2009 to those older reports, though the estimates from our current method are largely consistent with estimates produced with statistical models for similar years (12\u201313). \u00a0However, it is useful to keep in mind that direct comparisons to influenza disease burden decades ago are complicated by large differences in the age of the US population and the increasing number of adults aged \u226565 years.\nTop of PageWhy are these estimates lower than the preliminary in-season burden estimates last updated in April 2020?\nThese estimates are an update to the preliminary in-season 2019-20 burden estimates published April 2020 and are based on more recently available information. The current 2019-20 burden estimates are lower than those provided in April 2020 because of expected changes in available data on flu testing practices in patients hospitalized with flu, as well as unexpected data delays due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in Spring 2020.\nThere is a trade-off between timeliness and accuracy of burden of disease estimates. To provide timely burden estimates to the public, clinicians, and public health decision-makers, CDC uses preliminary data that may lead to over- or under-estimates of the true burden. However, each season\u2019s estimates will be finalized when data on testing practices and deaths for that season are available.\nFor these estimates, we included additional information to better capture flu testing practices at sites in the hospital-based surveillance system, FluSurv-NET, that collects data on patients hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed flu. Flu testing is done at the request of individual clinicians, but not everyone is tested, and flu tests are not perfectly accurate. Thus, reports of laboratory-confirmed flu-related hospitalizations to FluSurv-NET are underestimates of the true number of hospitalizations. To adjust for this, CDC collects data annually from participating FluSurv-NET sites on the amount of flu testing and the type of tests used at the site. This information is used to correct for the underestimates of flu-related hospitalizations. These testing data are often not available for up to 2 years after the end of a flu season, and thus the burden estimates are revised when additional testing data become available.\nThe preliminary in-season 2019-20 burden estimates were made using the highest flu testing rate for each age-group from the 2010-2011 through the 2016-2017 seasons. The current estimates were made using the highest testing rate for each age-group from the 2010-2011 through the 2017-2018 seasons. The additional data from the 2017-2018 flu season, which had high rates of flu testing, resulted in the 2019-2020 flu burden estimates being lower than those estimated earlier.\nIn addition to expected changes in available data on testing practices and patients hospitalized for flu, there were unexpected data delays due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in Spring 2020. The method used to estimate flu-related deaths relies on additional data from FluSurv-NET and the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) (data on cause of death and numbers of deaths that occur inside versus outside of the hospital). The additional mortality data from FluSurv-NET are typically not available for up to 2 years after the end of a flu season. However, data from FluSurv-NET that is usually available at the end of flu season was delayed in 2020 due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe 2019-2020 estimates that are presented here remain preliminary because not all of the data needed for final estimates are available. When additional data become available, these estimates will be updated again, and the results may change.\nMore answers to frequently asked questions about CDC\u2019s influenza burden estimates are available.\n\n\nTable 1: Estimated influenza disease burden, by age group \u2014 United States, 2019-2020 influenza season\n\n\n\nSymptomatic Illnesses\nMedical Visits\nHospitalizations\nDeaths\n\n\nAge group\nEstimate\n95% UI\nEstimate\n95% UI\nEstimate\n95% UI\nEstimate\n95%UI\n\n\n\n\n0-4 yrs\n4,291,677\n(3,065,436, 8,247,015)\n2,875,424\n(2,021,018, 5,544,822)\n29,920\n(21,371, 57,495)\n254\n(84, 554)\n\n\n5-17 yrs\n8,214,257\n(6,551,246, 11,351,951))\n4,271,413\n(3,315,969, 6,011,703)\n22,523\n(17,963, 31,126)\n180\n(35, 439)\n\n\n18-49 yrs\n15,325,708\n(11,798,086, 22,121,677)\n5,670,512\n(4,214,299, 8,383,456)\n86,023\n(66,223, 124,169)\n2,669\n(1,719, 4,601)\n\n\n50-64 yrs\n8,416,702\n(6,918,420, 10,835,295))\n3,619,182\n(2,832,003, 4,780,110)\n89,257\n(73,368, 114,905)\n5,133\n(3,534, 8,750)\n\n\n65+ yrs\n1,946,161\n(1,480,075, 2,883,659)\n1,089,850\n(797,945, 1,621,738)\n176,924\n(134,552, 262,151)\n13,673\n(10,298, 19,568)\n\n\nAll ages\n38,194,505\n(33,672,529, 47,034,054)\n17,526,381\n(15,371,515, 21,930,946)\n404,646\n(352,913, 503,531)\n21,909\n(17,970, 29,053)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: Estimated rates of influenza-associated disease outcomes, per 100,000, by age group \u2014 United States, 2019-2020 influenza season\n\n\n\nIllness rate\nMedical visit rate\nHospitalization rate\nMortality rate\n\n\nAge group\nEstimate\n95% UI\nEstimate\n95% UI\nEstimate\n95% UI\nEstimate\n95% UI\n\n\n\n\n0-4 yrs\n21,922.40\n(15,658.6, 42,126.7)\n14,688.00\n(10,323.6, 28,323.6)\n152.8\n(109.2, 293.7)\n1.3\n(0.4, 2.8)\n\n\n5-17 yrs\n15,364.50\n(12,253.9, 21,233.5)\n7,989.60\n( 6,202.4, 11,244.7)\n42.1\n(33.6, 58.2)\n0.3\n(0.1, 0.8)\n\n\n18-49 yrs\n11,088.20\n( 8,536.0, 16,005.1)\n4,102.60\n( 3,049.1, 6,065.5)\n62.2\n(47.9, 89.8)\n1.9\n(1.2, 3.3)\n\n\n50-64 yrs\n13,375.60\n(10,994.6, 17,219.2)\n5,751.50\n( 4,500.6, 7,596.4)\n141.8\n(116.6, 182.6)\n8.2\n(5.6, 13.9)\n\n\n65+ yrs\n3,600.10\n( 2,737.9, 5,334.4)\n2,016.10\n( 1,476.1, 3,000.0)\n327.3\n(248.9, 484.9)\n25.3\n(19.1, 36.2)\n\n\n\n\n\u202095% Uncertainty intervals\n*Some of the data used to calculate burden estimates are incomplete or not yet available.

The methods used to calculate the estimates have been described previously (1, 2, 6) and are outlined briefly below. CDC uses the estimates of the impact of influenza vaccination to inform policy and communications promoting influenza vaccination as the best way to prevent influenza.\n2019\u20132020 Estimates\nCDC estimates that during the 2019\u20132020 season 38 million people were ill, 18 million people went to a health care provider, 400,000 were hospitalized, and 22,000 died with influenza (7). The season was characterized by two consecutive waves of activity, beginning with influenza B viruses and followed by A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses. Overall, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were the most commonly reported influenza viruses this season. The number of influenza-associated illnesses, medically attended illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths were lower than some more recent seasons and similar to other seasons during which influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses dominated (8).\nInfluenza vaccination prevented an estimated 7.52 million illnesses, 3.69 million medical visits, 105,000 hospitalizations, and 6,300 deaths due to influenza during the 2019-2020 season. The number and proportion of influenza-associated hospitalizations prevented by vaccination during 2019\u20132020 varied by age group, due to age-specific differences in influenza burden, vaccine coverage, and vaccine effectiveness. Vaccination prevented the lowest proportion of illnesses among adults aged 18 to 49 years, the age group in which vaccination coverage is lowest, and among children aged 5-17 years, for whom vaccine effectiveness was low for both influenza B and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses. Vaccination prevented the greatest proportion of outcomes among children aged 6 months to 4 years, an age group in which there was high vaccine uptake and the vaccine effectiveness was greatest.\nInfluenza vaccination is the best way to protect against influenza and associated complications; however, more effective or longer lasting influenza vaccines are needed. Several efforts are currently underway to understand and investigate factors that contribute to reduced or increased vaccine effectiveness and inform changes to vaccine composition, formulations, or production (9-11).\nImprovements in vaccine coverage could also provide a greater public health benefit, producing even greater reductions in illnesses and demands for resources from the health system. During influenza season, the health care system, including outpatient clinics, emergency departments, and hospitals, experience high patient volumes. Any reduction in influenza-associated medical visits and hospitalizations will reduce demands on the healthcare system stressed by the COVID-19 pandemic and improve healthcare providers\u2019 abilities to provide the best care. Strategies to improve influenza vaccine coverage include: using patient reminder/recall systems aided by immunization information systems; expanding access to vaccination at pharmacies, workplaces, and schools; and organizing mobile and/or outdoor vaccination clinics that would allow for social distancing among patients and healthcare providers.\nConclusion\nCDC estimates that influenza vaccination during the 2019\u20132020 influenza season prevented 7.52 million illnesses, 3.69 million medical visits, 105,000 hospitalizations, and 6,300 deaths associated with influenza. This report underscores the benefits of the current vaccination program, but highlights areas where improvements in vaccine uptake and vaccine effectiveness could deliver even greater benefits to the public\u2019s health.\nLimitations\nThese estimates are subject to several limitations. First, influenza vaccination coverage estimates were derived from reports by survey respondents, not vaccination records, and are subject to recall bias. These coverage estimates are based on telephone surveys with relatively low response rates; nonresponse bias may remain after weighting for the survey design. Estimates of the number of persons vaccinated based on these survey data have often exceeded the actual number of doses distributed, indicating that coverage estimates used in this report may overestimate the numbers of illnesses and hospitalizations averted by vaccination. The model of averted illness calculates outcomes directly prevented among persons who were vaccinated. If indirect protection from decreased exposure to infectious persons in a partially vaccinated population (i.e., herd immunity) also occurred, the model would underestimate the number of illnesses and hospitalizations prevented by vaccination. Estimates of the averted burden in older adults, aged \u226565 years, do not reflect the increasing use of high-dose or adjuvanted influenza vaccines, which may have higher effectiveness compared with standard vaccines; nor does the estimate reflect that vaccine effectiveness might continue to decrease with age, reaching very low levels among the oldest adults who also have the highest rates of influenza vaccination. Finally, because the data and methods used to make these calculations are continually updated, current estimates are preliminary and will be updated when final data are available.\nPrevious Estimates\nPrevious estimates of the burden of illness, medical visits, hospitalizations, and deaths related to influenza and prevented by influenza vaccination are available online and in publications (1-5). \u00a0Past seasons\u2019 estimates of influenza disease burden averted by vaccination, using the same methodology as for the 2019-2020 season, are available to provide context for the current season\u2019s estimates.\n2019-2020 Tables for Influenza Burden and Burden-Averted Estimates\n\n\nTable 1: Influenza vaccine coverage, by age group \u2014 United States 2019\u20132020 influenza season\n\n\n\nVaccine coverage *\u00a0\nVaccine effectiveness against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09\u2020\nVaccine effectiveness against influenza B/Victoria\u2020 \n\n\nAge Group\n%\n95% CI\n%\n95% CI\n%\n95% CI\n\n\n\n6 months-4 years\n\n75.5\n74.5\u201376.5\n28\n-6\u201352\n57\n34\u201372\n\n\n\n5-17 yrs\n\n60.2\n59.5\u201360.9\n22\n-4\u201341\n35\n18\u201348\n\n\n\n18-49 yrs\n\n38.4\n37.6\u201339.2\n26\n9\u201339\n45\n30\u201356\n\n\n\n50-64 yrs\n\n50.6\n49.2\u201352.0\n40\n20\u201356\n44\n0\u201368\n\n\n\n\u226565 years\n\n69.8\n68.6\u201371.0\n42\n9\u201364\n34\n-40\u201369\n\n\n\n\n*Estimates from FluVaxView.

Reported hospitalization rates were adjusted using a multiplier to correct for underreporting, which is calculated from the percent of persons hospitalized with respiratory illness who were tested for influenza and the average sensitivity of influenza tests used in the surveillance hospitals. These values were measured from data collected during eight post-pandemic seasons; estimates of underreporting of influenza-related hospitalizations\nAdjusted rates were applied to the U.S. population by age group to calculate the numbers of influenza-associated hospitalizations. The numbers of influenza illnesses were then estimated from hospitalizations based on previously measured ratios that reflect the estimated number of ill persons per hospitalization in each age group (5).\nThe numbers of persons seeking medical care for influenza were then calculated using age group-specific data on the percentages of persons with a respiratory illness who sought medical care, which were estimated from results of the 2010 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey (14).\nAll estimates were rounded to three significant digits.\n\u00a0\nHow does CDC estimate the number of influenza-associated outcomes that were prevented with influenza vaccination?\nThe annual estimates of influenza vaccination coverage by month during each season and the final end-of-season vaccine effectiveness measurements were used to estimate how many persons were not protected by vaccination during the season and thus were at risk for these outcomes.\nThe rate of each outcome among persons at risk was then used to estimate the number of influenza-associated outcomes that would have been expected in the same population if no one had been protected by vaccination. Finally, the averted outcomes attributable to vaccination were calculated as the difference between outcomes in the hypothetical unvaccinated population and the observed vaccinated population.\nEstimates of 2019\u20132020 influenza vaccination coverage by month from July 2019 through April 2020, were based on self-report or parental report of vaccination status using data from the National Immunization Survey for children aged 6 months-17 years and Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey data for adults aged \u226518 years (12).\nVaccine effectiveness estimates for the 2019\u20132020 season were derived from the US Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Network, a group of five academic institutions that conduct annual vaccine effectiveness studies. (13) The network estimates the effectiveness of vaccination for preventing influenza diagnosed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction-positive testing among persons with acute respiratory illness of \u22647 days duration seen in hospitals, emergency departments, or outpatient clinics in communities in\nCalculations were stratified by month of the year to account for annual variations in the timing of disease and vaccination and then summed across the whole season. The prevented fraction was calculated as the number of averted illnesses divided by the total illnesses that would have been expected in an unvaccinated population.\nThe Benefits of Flu Vaccination 2019-2020 Infographic\n\nFull Sized Infographic\nThe Benefits of Flu Vaccination 2019-2020 Infographic (Text Version)\nNearly 52% of the U.S. population aged 6 months and older got a flu vaccine during the 2019-2020 flu season, and this prevented an estimated:\n7.5 million flu illnesses, more than the combined population of Kentucky and Kansas.\n105,000 flu hospitalizations, enough people to fill Michigan Stadium at the University of Michigan.\n6,300 flu deaths, equivalent to saving about 17 lives per day over the course of a year.\nCDC logo\nGet vaccinated.\nwww.cdc.gov/flu \u200b\nReferences\n\nKostova D, Reed C, Finelli L, Cheng PY, Gargiullo PM, Shay DK, et al.

Clinicians may also wish to consult the IDSA antiviral treatment and antiviral chemoprophylaxis recommendationsexternal icon, and the ATS-IDSA Adult CAP Guidelinesexternal icon.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNeed to fill a prescription for flu antivirals?\nexternal iconFind Flu MedicationPriority Groups for Antiviral Treatment of InfluenzaAntiviral treatment is recommended as soon as possible for any patient with suspected or confirmed influenza who:\n\nis hospitalized;\nhas severe, complicated, or progressive illness; or\nis at higher risk for influenza complications.\n\nDecisions about starting antiviral treatment for patients with suspected influenza should not wait for laboratory confirmation of influenza virus infection. Empiric antiviral treatment should be started as soon as possible in the above priority groups.\nClinicians can consider early empiric antiviral treatment of non-high-risk outpatients with suspected influenza [e.g., influenza-like illness (fever with either cough or sore throat)] based upon clinical judgement, if treatment can be initiated within 48 hours of illness onset.\nAntiviral Drug Options\n\nFor hospitalized patients with suspected or confirmed influenza, initiation of antiviral treatment with oral or enterically-administered oseltamivir is recommended as soon as possible.\nFor outpatients with complications or progressive disease and suspected or confirmed influenza (e.g., pneumonia, or exacerbation of underlying chronic medical conditions), initiation of antiviral treatment with oral oseltamivir is recommended as soon as possible.\nFor outpatients with suspected or confirmed uncomplicated influenza, oral oseltamivir, inhaled zanamivir, intravenous peramivir, or oral baloxavir\u00a0may be used for treatment, depending upon approved age groups and contraindications. In one randomized controlled trial, baloxavir had greater efficacy than oseltamivir in adolescents and adults with influenza B virus infection (Ison, 2020external icon).\n\nMoreCo-circulation of Influenza Viruses and SARS-CoV-2During periods of community co-circulation of influenza viruses and SARS-CoV-2, empiric antiviral treatment of influenza is recommended as soon as possible for the following priority groups: a) hospitalized patients with respiratory illness; b) outpatients with severe, complicated, or progressive respiratory illness; and c) outpatients at higher risk for influenza complications who present with any acute respiratory illness symptoms (with or without fever).\n\nInfluenza and COVID-19 have overlapping signs and symptoms. Testing can help distinguish between influenza virus infection and SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, clinicians should not wait for the results of influenza testing (view Table 3), SARS-CoV-2 testing, or multiplex molecular assays that detect influenza A and B viruses and SARS-CoV-2 (view Table 4) to initiate empiric antiviral treatment for influenza in the above priority groups.\nCo-infection with influenza A or B viruses and SARS-CoV-2 can occur and should be considered, particularly in hospitalized patients with severe respiratory disease.\n\nClinicians should be aware that a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result does not preclude influenza virus infection. For hospitalized patients with suspected influenza who are started on empiric antiviral treatment with oseltamivir, use of influenza molecular assays (view Table 3) or multiplex assays that detect both influenza viruses and SARS-CoV-2 (view Table 4) can inform clinical management.\nClinicians should be aware that a positive influenza test result does not preclude SARS-CoV-2 infection. For hospitalized patients with a positive influenza test result, antiviral treatment of influenza with oseltamivir should be started as soon as possible, and clinicians should also follow guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (view community acquired pneumonia treatment guidance for adults: Metlay, 2019external icon) and other respiratory infections, including SARS-CoV-2 infection (view\u00a0NIH COVID-19 treatment guidelinesexternal icon and IDSA COVID-19 treatment guidelinesexternal icon) if clinically indicated, while awaiting SARS-CoV-2 testing results. Oseltamivir does not have in-vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2 (Choy, 2020external icon).\n\n\nClinicians can utilize telemedicine in place of office visits for patients with acute respiratory illness. It may be useful for providers to implement phone triage lines to enable high-risk patients to discuss symptoms over the phone. Please see the Algorithm to Assist in Medical Office Telephone Evaluation of Patients with Possible Influenza.\nPatients at\u00a0higher risk for influenza complications should be advised to call their provider as soon as possible if they have acute respiratory illness symptoms (with or without fever)\u00a0for consideration of infection with influenza A or B viruses (and early antiviral treatment), SARS-CoV-2, and other respiratory pathogens.\nClinicians can consider starting early (\u226448 hours after illness onset) empiric antiviral treatment of non-high-risk outpatients with suspected influenza [e.g., influenza-like illness (fever with either cough or sore throat)], based upon clinical judgement, including without an office visit. SARS-CoV-2 and other etiologies of influenza-like illness should also be considered.\nNational Institutes of Health (NIH) COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines: Influenza and COVID-19 are availableexternal icon.\nClinical algorithms for the testing and treatment of influenza when SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses are circulating are also available.\n\n\nOpen All Close All\n\n\nOverview of Influenza Antiviral Medications\n\n\n\nAntiviral medications with activity against influenza viruses are an important adjunct to influenza vaccine in the control of influenza.\n\nInfluenza antiviral prescription drugs can be used to\u00a0treat\u00a0influenza, and some can be used to\u00a0prevent\u00a0influenza.\nSix licensed prescription influenza antiviral drugs are approved in the United States.\n\nFour influenza antiviral medications approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are recommended for use in the United States during the 2020-2021 influenza season.\n\nThree drugs are chemically related antiviral medications known as neuraminidase inhibitors that block the viral neuraminidase enzyme and have activity against both influenza A and B viruses:\u00a0 oral\u00a0oseltamivir\u00a0phosphate\u00a0(available as a generic version or under the trade name Tamiflu\u00ae), inhaled\u00a0zanamivir\u00a0(trade name Relenza\u00ae), and intravenous\u00a0peramivir\u00a0(trade name Rapivab\u00ae).\nThe fourth drug is oral\u00a0baloxavir marboxil\u00a0(trade name Xofluza\u00ae), which is active against both influenza A and B viruses but has a different mechanism of action than neuraminidase inhibitors.\u00a0 Baloxavir is a cap-dependent endonuclease inhibitor that interferes with viral RNA transcription and blocks virus replication.\nMore information regarding the four recommended antiviral medications is available: Table 1.\n\n\n\n\nAmantadine and rimantadine are antiviral drugs in a class of medications known as adamantanes, which target the M2 ion channel protein of influenza A viruses. Therefore, these medications are active against influenza A viruses, but not influenza B viruses. As in recent past seasons, there continues to be high levels of resistance (>99%) to adamantanes among circulating influenza A(H3N2) and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (\u201c2009 H1N1\u201d) viruses. Therefore, amantadine and rimantadine are not recommended for antiviral treatment or chemoprophylaxis of currently circulating influenza A viruses.\nAntiviral resistance and reduced susceptibility to the neuraminidase inhibitors and to baloxavir among circulating influenza viruses is currently very low, but this can change.\n\nFor weekly surveillance data on susceptibility of circulating influenza viruses to antivirals in the U.S. this season, see the FluView Weekly U.S. Influenza Surveillance Report.\n\n\nInfluenza viruses with reduced susceptibility or resistance to antivirals can occur sporadically or emerge during or after antiviral treatment in some patients (e.g., immunocompromised). Oseltamivir resistance in influenza A(H3N2) and A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses can develop during treatment, particularly in young children (Roosenhoff, 2019external icon; Lina, 2018external icon;), and immunocompromised persons (Memoli, 2014)external icon. Following treatment with baloxavir, emergence of viruses with molecular markers associated with reduced susceptibility to baloxavir has been observed in clinical trials in immunocompetent children and adults, with higher detection among baloxavir-treated pediatric patients aged <12 years compared with adults (Hayden, 2018external icon;\u00a0Omoto, 2018external icon; Hirostu, 2019external icon; Uehara, 2019external icon; Takashita, 2019external icon).\n\nHuman-to-human transmission of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses with an H275Y mutation in viral neuraminidase conferring resistance to oseltamivir has been reported among severely immunocompromised patients in hospital units,\u00a0 (Gooskens, 2009external icon; Chen, 2011external icon;) and in the community (Hibino, 2017external icon; Le, 2008;external icon Hurt, 2011external icon; Hurt, 2012external icon; Takashita, 2013)external icon, but currently appears to be uncommon.\nLimited human-to-human transmission of influenza A(H3N2) virus with reduced susceptibility to baloxavir has been reported sporadically in Japanese children (Takashita, 2019external icon; Takashita 2019external icon; Imai, 2019external icon), but currently appears to be uncommon.\n\n\nClinical trials and observational data show that early antiviral treatment can shorten the duration of fever and illness symptoms, and may reduce the risk of some\u00a0complications from influenza\u00a0(e.g., otitis media in young children, pneumonia, and respiratory failure).\n\nEarly treatment of hospitalized adult influenza patients with oseltamivir has been reported to reduce death in some observational studies.\nIn hospitalized children, early antiviral treatment with oseltamivir has been reported to shorten the duration of hospitalization in observational studies.\nClinical benefit is greatest when antiviral treatment is administered early, especially within 48 hours of influenza illness onset in clinical trials and observational studies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Antiviral Medications Recommended for Treatment and Chemoprophylaxis of Influenza\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.

Although not part of the FDA-approved indications, use of oral oseltamivir for treatment of influenza in infants less than 14 days old, and for chemoprophylaxis in infants 3 months to 1 year, is recommended by the CDC and the American Academy of Pediatrics. If a child is younger than 3 months old, use of oseltamivir for chemoprophylaxis is not recommended unless the situation is judged critical due to limited data in this age group.\n2\u00a0Self-injury or delirium; mainly reported among Japanese pediatric patients.\n3\u00a0Inhaled zanamivir is contraindicated in patients with underlying airways disease such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and those with a history of allergy to lactose or milk protein.\n4\u00a0Intravenous peramivir is approved by the FDA for treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza within 2 days of illness onset in people 2 years and older. Peramivir efficacy is based on clinical trials versus placebo in which the predominant influenza virus type was influenza A; in one trial, a very limited number of subjects infected with influenza B virus were enrolled.\n5 There are no data for use of peramivir for chemoprophylaxis of influenza. On November 23, 2020, FDA approved baloxavir for post-exposure prophylaxis of influenza in persons aged 12 years and older. One study of baloxavir post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) of influenza in household members aged 12 years and older (73% received baloxavir within 24 hours of onset of symptoms in the index household case who received antiviral treatment) reported that the risk of laboratory-confirmed influenza was significantly lower, by 86%, among those who received baloxavir PEP than among those who received placebo (1.9% [7 of 374] vs. 13.6% [51 of 375]; adjusted risk ratio, 0.14; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.06 to 0.30; P<0.001).\n6 Oral baloxavir marboxil is approved by the FDA for treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza within 2 days of illness onset in people 12 years and older who are otherwise healthy, or at high risk of developing influenza-related complications. The safety and efficacy of baloxavir for the treatment of influenza have been established in pediatric patients 12 years and older weighing at least 40 kg.. Baloxavir efficacy for initial FDA approval in October 2018 was based on clinical trials in previously healthy outpatients 12 to 64 years old (Hayden, 2018external icon). Single-dose baloxavir treatment was superior to placebo and had similar clinical efficacy in time to alleviation of symptoms to a 5-day treatment course of oseltamivir. In October 2019, FDA approved an indication for baloxavir treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza within 2 days of illness onset in people 12 years and older at high risk of developing influenza-related complications, based upon the findings of a clinical trial (Ison, 2020external icon; Baloxavir marboxil (Xofluza)\u00a0 pdf icon[package insert]external icon. U.S. Food and Drug Administration website; 2019). In this clinical trial of early initiation of antiviral treatment for uncomplicated influenza in high-risk patients, baloxavir was superior to placebo and had similar overall efficacy to oseltamivir in the time to alleviation of symptoms. For patients with influenza B virus infection, baloxavir significantly reduced the median time to improvement of symptoms compared with oseltamivir by more than 24 hours. However, there are no available data for baloxavir treatment of influenza in pregnant women, immunocompromised people, or in people with severe influenza. There are no available data from clinical trials for baloxavir treatment of hospitalized patients with influenza.\n\n\n\n\nSummary of Influenza Antiviral Treatment Recommendations\n\n\n\n\nAntiviral treatment is recommended as early as possible for any patient with confirmed or suspected influenza who:\n\nis hospitalized;*\nhas severe, complicated, or progressive illness;* or\nis at higher risk for influenza complications.\n\n\n\n*Note: Oral oseltamivir is the recommended antiviral for patients with severe, complicated, or progressive illness who are not hospitalized, and for hospitalized influenza patients.\n\nAntiviral treatment also can be considered for any previously healthy, symptomatic outpatient not at high risk for influenza complications, who is diagnosed with confirmed or suspected influenza, on the basis of clinical judgment, if treatment can be initiated within 48 hours of illness onset.\n\nFigure: Guide for considering influenza testing and treatment when influenza viruses are circulating in the community (regardless of influenza vaccination history)1\n\nComplete footnotes for this algorithm are available.\n\nClinical judgment, on the basis of the patient\u2019s disease severity and progression, age, underlying medical conditions, likelihood of influenza, and time since onset of symptoms, is important when making antiviral treatment decisions for high-risk outpatients.\nWhen indicated, antiviral treatment should be started as soon as possible after illness onset, ideally within 48 hours of symptom onset. However, antiviral treatment might have some benefits in patients with severe, complicated or progressive illness, and in hospitalized patients when started after 48 hours of illness onset.\n\nObservational studies in hospitalized patients with influenza have reported that clinical benefit is greatest when oseltamivir is started within 48 hours of illness onset (Hsu, 2012external icon; Louie, 2013external icon; Muthuri, 2013external icon; Muthuri, 2014external icon). However, some studies suggest that antiviral treatment might still be beneficial in hospitalized patients when started up to 4 or 5 days after illness onset (Louie, 2012external icon; Yu, 2011external icon). Antiviral treatment of pregnant women (of any trimester) with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection has been shown to be most beneficial in preventing respiratory failure and death when started within less than 3 days of illness onset, but still provided benefit when started 3\u20134 days after onset compared to 5 or more days (Siston, 2010external icon).\u00a0One observational study reported that initiating neuraminidase inhibitor treatment within 6 hours after hospital admission was associated with shorter duration of hospitalization versus starting antiviral treatment later (Katzen, 2018external icon). Another observational study reported that neuraminidase inhibitor treatment initiated at the time of hospitalization was associated with a significant reduction in hospital length of stay in patients with clinically suspected or laboratory-confirmed influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection compared with later initiation or no NAI treatment (Venkatesan, 2019external icon).\n\n\nDecisions about starting antiviral treatment should not wait for laboratory confirmation of influenza (see resources regarding Clinical Description and Lab Diagnosis of Influenza\u00a0for more information on influenza diagnostic testing).\n\nClinical benefit is greatest when antiviral treatment is started as close to illness onset as possible.\n\n\nWhile influenza vaccination is the best way to prevent influenza illness, a history of influenza vaccination does not rule out the possibility of influenza virus infection in an ill patient with clinical signs and symptoms compatible with influenza.\nAntiviral treatment also can be considered for any previously healthy, symptomatic outpatient not at high risk with confirmed or suspected influenza on the basis of clinical judgment, if treatment can be initiated within 48 hours of illness onset. Multiple randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses of RCTs have demonstrated efficacy of early initiation of treatment (started within 48 hours of illness onset) with neuraminidase inhibitors in reducing duration of fever and illness symptoms compared with placebo in otherwise healthy children and adults with uncomplicated influenza (Hayden, 1997external icon;\u00a0Monto, 1999external icon;\u00a0Monto, 1999external icon;\u00a0Nicholson, 2000external icon;\u00a0Hedrick, 2000external icon;\u00a0Treanor, 2000external icon;\u00a0Whitley, 2001external icon;\u00a0Heinonen, 2010external icon;\u00a0Fry, 2014external icon;\u00a0Whitley, 2015external icon;\u00a0Kohno, 2010external icon;\u00a0Hsu, 2012external icon;\u00a0Jefferson, 2014external icon;\u00a0Whitley, 2015external icon;,\u00a0Dobson, 2015external icon;\u00a0Malosh, 2017external icon).\n\nOne randomized clinical trial in children with uncomplicated influenza demonstrated a modest reduction in duration of symptoms and influenza virus shedding in patients initiating treatment after 48 hours; post hoc analysis suggested that oseltamivir treatment initiated 72 hours after illness onset reduced symptoms by one day compared with placebo (Fry, 2014external icon).\n\n\nFor outpatients with acute uncomplicated influenza, oral oseltamivir, inhaled zanamivir, intravenous peramivir, or oral baloxavir may be used for treatment.\n\nThe recommended treatment course for uncomplicated influenza is two doses per day of oral oseltamivir or inhaled zanamivir for 5 days, or one dose of intravenous peramivir or oral baloxavir for 1 day.\nOnly one randomized clinical trial has compared baloxavir to oseltamivir for treatment of influenza B. This study found that baloxavir treatment was superior to oseltamivir among outpatients with influenza B virus infection (Ison, 2020external icon).\nCDC does not recommend use of baloxavir for treatment of influenza in pregnant women or breastfeeding mothers. There are no available efficacy or safety data for baloxavir in pregnant women, and there are no available data on the presence of baloxavir in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production.\nCDC does not recommend use of baloxavir for monotherapy of influenza in severely immunosuppressed persons. There are no available efficacy, safety, or resistance data for baloxavir monotherapy of influenza\u00a0in severely immunosuppressed patients and emergence of resistance during treatment is a concern because of prolonged influenza viral replication in these patients.\nThere are no available data on the use of baloxavir for treatment of influenza more than 2 days after illness onset.\n\n\nOral oseltamivir is preferred for treatment of pregnant women (Rasmussenexternal icon,; 2011external icon). Pregnant women are recommended to receive the same antiviral dosing as non-pregnant people. Multiple recent studies have reported safe use of neuraminidase inhibitors during pregnancy (Dunstan, 2014external icon;\u00a0Xie, 2013external icon;\u00a0Saito, 2013external icon;\u00a0Wollenhaupt, 2014external icon;\u00a0Beau, 2014external icon;\u00a0Svensson, 2011external icon;\u00a0Greer, 2010external icon;\u00a0Graner, 2017external icon);\u00a0Ehrenstien, 2018external icon;\u00a0Chambers, 2019external icon; Bennekom, 2019external icon; ACOG Committee, 2018external icon). See Recommendations for Obstetric Health Care Providers Related to Use of Antiviral Medications in the Treatment and Prevention of Influenza\u00a0for additional information. Baloxavir is not recommended for the treatment of influenza in pregnant women, as there are no available efficacy or safety data for baloxavir in this population.\nFor patients with severe or complicated illness with suspected or confirmed influenza (e.g., pneumonia, or exacerbation of underlying chronic medical condition) who are not hospitalized, antiviral treatment with oral or enterically-administered oseltamivir is recommended as soon as possible.\u00a0There are insufficient data for inhaled zanamivir and intravenous peramivir in patients with severe influenza disease. There are no available data from clinical trials on use of baloxavir treatment in patients with severe influenza disease.\n\n\n\n\nPeople at Higher risk for Influenza Complications Recommended for Antiviral Treatment\n\n\n\n\nchildren younger than 2 years;1\nadults 65 years and older;\npeople with chronic pulmonary (including asthma), cardiovascular (except hypertension alone), renal, hepatic, hematological (including sickle cell disease), and metabolic disorders (including diabetes mellitus), or neurologic and neurodevelopment conditions (including disorders of the brain, spinal cord, peripheral nerve, and muscle, such as cerebral palsy, epilepsy [seizure disorders], stroke, intellectual disability, moderate to severe developmental delay, muscular dystrophy, or spinal cord injury);\npeople with immunosuppression, including that caused by medications or by HIV infection;\nwomen who are pregnant or postpartum (within 2 weeks after delivery);\npeople younger than 19 years old who are receiving long-term aspirin- or salicylate-containing medications\nAmerican Indians/Alaska Natives;\npeople who are extremely obese (i.e., body mass index is equal to or greater than 40); and\nresidents of nursing homes and other chronic care facilities.\n\n1 Although all children younger than 5 years old are considered at higher risk for complications from influenza, the highest risk is for those younger than 2 years old, with the highest hospitalization and death rates among infants younger than 6 months old. Because many children with mild febrile respiratory illness might have other viral infections (e.g., respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus, or human metapneumovirus), knowledge of other respiratory viruses as well as influenza virus strains circulating in the community is important for treatment decisions.\n\n\n\nTreatment Considerations for Patients Hospitalized with Suspected or Confirmed Influenza\n\n\n\nTreatment of patients with severe influenza (e.g., those requiring hospitalization) presents multiple challenges. The effect of specific antiviral strategies in serious or life-threatening influenza is not established from clinical trials conducted to support licensure of oral oseltamivir, inhaled zanamivir, intravenous peramivir, or oral baloxavir, as those studies were conducted primarily among previously healthy outpatients with uncomplicated illness. No randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials have been conducted of neuraminidase inhibitors for treatment of influenza in hospitalized patients. However, a number of observational studies in hospitalized influenza patients have shown clinical benefit of neuraminidase inhibitor antiviral treatment compared with no treatment, particularly when started within two days of influenza illness, including reducing the duration of hospitalization or risk of death (Hiba, 2011external icon;\u00a0Coffin, 2011external icon;\u00a0Hsu, 2012external icon;\u00a0Louie, 2013external icon;\u00a0Muthuri, 2013external icon; Muthuri, 2014external icon; Miyakawa, 2019external icon; Lytras, 2019external icon; Katzen, 2019;external icon Reacher, 2019external icon).\u00a0 In addition, some observational studies have reported that oral oseltamivir treatment started 4 and 5 days after illness onset in \u00a0patients hospitalized with suspected or confirmed influenza was \u00a0associated with lower risk for severe outcomes (EH Lee, 2010external icon;\u00a0N Lee, 2008external icon;\u00a0N Lee, 2010external icon;\u00a0Louie, 2012external icon;\u00a0McGeer, 2007external icon;\u00a0Siston, 2010external icon), although one report found this benefit only in hospitalized adult patients in the ICU (Muthuri, 2014external icon). A small number of observational studies and one meta-analysis of observational studies of hospitalized influenza patients reported that neuraminidase inhibitor treatment did not have survival benefit (Choi, 2017external icon;\u00a0Wolkewitz, 2016external icon;\u00a0Heneghan, 2016external icon).\nThe following recommendations do not necessarily represent FDA-approved uses of antiviral products but are based on published observational studies and expert opinion and are subject to change as the developmental status of investigational products and the epidemiologic and virologic features of influenza change over time.\n\nFor hospitalized patients with suspected or confirmed influenza, initiation of antiviral treatment with oral or enterically-administered oseltamivir is recommended as soon as possible.\u00a0Antiviral treatment might be effective in reducing morbidity and mortality in hospitalized influenza patients, especially adults, even if treatment is started more than 48 hours after onset of illness.\nInhaled zanamivir and oral baloxavir are not recommended because of the lack of data in hospitalized influenza patients. There are also insufficient data for treatment of hospitalized influenza patients with intravenous peramivir. A\u00a0randomized clinical trialexternal icon of baloxavir treatment of influenza in hospitalized patients aged 12 years and older is in-progress.\nFor patients with lower respiratory tract disease, lower respiratory tract specimens, such as bronchoalveolar lavage fluid or endotracheal aspirates, are preferred; an oropharyngeal (throat) swab may be collected if lower respiratory specimens are not available. Testing of lower respiratory tract specimens may detect influenza viruses when testing of upper respiratory tract specimens is negative. Multiple respiratory tract specimens collected on different days should be tested if influenza virus infection is suspected but a definitive diagnosis has not been made.\nThe optimal duration and dosing of antiviral treatment are uncertain for severe or complicated influenza. Treatment regimens might need to be altered to fit the clinical circumstances. For example, clinical judgment should be the guide regarding the need to extend daily treatment regimens longer than 5 days for patients whose illness is prolonged. Critically ill patients with respiratory failure can have prolonged influenza viral replication in the lower respiratory tract and might benefit from longer duration of treatment.\n\nClinical judgment and virologic testing of lower respiratory tract specimens by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) should guide decisions to consider treatment regimens longer than 5 days for hospitalized influenza patients with severe and prolonged illness.\nLonger treatment regimens might be necessary in immunosuppressed people who may have prolonged influenza viral replication. Such patients are at risk of emergence of influenza viruses with reduced susceptibility or antiviral resistance during or after antiviral treatment.\nA higher dose of oral or enterically-administered oseltamivir has been recommended by some experts (e.g., 150 mg twice daily in adults with normal renal function) for treatment of influenza in immunocompromised patients and in severely ill hospitalized patients. However, oral or enterically administered oseltamivir has been reported to be adequately absorbed in critically ill adults, with standard doses producing therapeutic blood levels (Ariano, 2010external icon), and available data suggest that higher dosing may not provide additional clinical benefit (Abdel-Ghafar, 2008external icon;\u00a0Ariano, 2010external icon;\u00a0Kumar, 2010external icon;\u00a0Lee, 2013external icon;\u00a0South East Asia Infectious Disease Clinical Research Network, 2013external icon). Studies indicate that the exposure to oseltamivir carboxylate (the active metabolite of oseltamivir) is similar between obese and non-obese subjects for both 75 mg and 150 mg doses given twice daily (Ariano, 2010external icon;\u00a0Jittamala, 2014external icon;\u00a0Pai, 2011external icon;\u00a0Thorne-Humphrey, 2011external icon).\n\n\nLimited data suggest that oseltamivir administered orally or by oro/naso gastric tube is well absorbed in critically ill influenza patients, including those receiving continuous renal replacement therapy, and/or on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (Ariano, 2010external icon;\u00a0Eyler, 2012aexternal icon;\u00a0Eyler, 2012bexternal icon;\u00a0Giraud, 2011external icon;\u00a0Kromdijk, 2013external icon;\u00a0Lemaitre, 2012external icon;\u00a0Mulla, 2013external icon;\u00a0Taylor, 2008external icon).\nFor patients who cannot tolerate or absorb oral or enterically-administered oseltamivir because of suspected or known gastric stasis, malabsorption, or gastrointestinal bleeding, the use of intravenous peramivir should be considered (Lee, 2017external icon;\u00a0deJong, 2014external icon;\u00a0Ison, 2014external icon;\u00a0Ison, 2013external icon).\n\nIn a randomized trial of treatment of influenza in hospitalized patients >6 years old, a significant clinical benefit was not demonstrated for intravenous peramivir at a dosage of 600 mg once daily (10 mg/kg once daily in children) for five days plus standard of care compared with placebo plus standard of care; however, peramivir was generally safe and well tolerated (de Jong, 2014external icon)\n\n\nIt is possible that some influenza viruses may become less susceptible or resistant to oseltamivir and peramivir during antiviral treatment with one of these drugs and remain susceptible to zanamivir; this has been reported most often for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses (Graitcer, 2011; Lackenby, 2011; Memoli, 2010; Nguyen, 2010; Nguyen, 2012) Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses have also emerged that are resistant to all neuraminidase inhibitors, including zanamivir, in highly immunosuppressed patients on prolonged neuraminidase inhibitor treatment (Tamura, 2015external icon;\u00a0L\u2019Huillier, 2015external icon). Resistance and reduced susceptibility of influenza viruses to antiviral drugs can also occur spontaneously, with no known exposure to antiviral medications (Hurt, 2011external icon;\u00a0Takashita, 2013external icon;\u00a0Takashita, 2014external icon).\nIf a hospitalized patient treated with oseltamivir or peramivir manifests progressive lower respiratory symptoms, resistant virus should be considered. However, clinicians should note that failure to improve or clinical deterioration during oseltamivir or peramivir treatment is more likely to be related to the natural history of acute lung injury and inflammatory damage or onset of other complications (e.g., renal failure, septic shock, ventilator-associated pneumonia) than to emergence of oseltamivir or peramivir resistance. Severely immunosuppressed people (e.g., hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients) are at highest risk for emergence of oseltamivir- and peramivir-resistant influenza virus infection during or following oseltamivir and/or peramivir treatment (Hurt, 2012external icon;\u00a0Memoli, 2010external icon). Molecular analyses can detect genetic changes in influenza viruses associated with resistance and reduced susceptibility to oseltamivir and peramivir. The CDC Influenza Division is available for consultation regarding antiviral susceptibility testing as needed. Information about neuraminidase inhibitor susceptibility testing and interpretation of results of neuraminidase inhibition assays is available on the\u00a0WHO websiteexternal icon.\nIntravenous zanamivir is an investigational parenterally administered neuraminidase inhibitor product that has been available in the past through enrollment in a clinical trial or under an emergency investigational new drug (EIND) request to the manufacturer. However, since the 2017-18 season, intravenous zanamivir is no longer available in the United States.\nCareful attention to ventilator and fluid management and to the prevention and treatment of secondary bacterial pneumonia (e.g.,\u00a0S. pneumoniae,\u00a0S. pyogenes, and\u00a0S. aureus, including MRSA) also is critical for severely ill patients (Bautista, 2010external icon;\u00a0Finelli, 2008external icon;\u00a0Hageman, 2006external icon;\u00a0Harper, 2009pdf iconexternal icon;\u00a0Mandell, 2007external icon;\u00a0Mauad, 2010external icon;\u00a0Shieh, 2010external icon).\n\n\n\n\nTable 2.

Although not part of the FDA-approved indications, use of oral oseltamivir for treatment of influenza in infants less than 14 days old, and for chemoprophylaxis in infants 3 months to 1 year of age, is recommended by the CDC and the American Academy of Pediatrics (Committee on Infectious Diseases, 2018external icon).\n3This is the FDA-approved oral oseltamivir treatment dose for infants 14 days and older and less than 1 year old, and provides oseltamivir exposure in children similar to that achieved by the approved dose of 75 mg orally twice daily for adults, as shown in two studies of oseltamivir pharmacokinetics in children (Kimberlin, 2013 [CASG 114], EU study WP22849, FDA Clinical Pharmacology Reviewexternal icon). The American Academy of Pediatrics has recommended an oseltamivir treatment dose of 3.5 mg/kg orally twice daily for infants 9-11 months old, on the basis of data which indicated that a higher dose of 3.5 mg/kg was needed to achieve the protocol-defined targeted exposure for this cohort as defined in the CASG 114 study (Kimberlin, 2013external icon). It is unknown whether this higher dose will improve efficacy or prevent the development of antiviral resistance. However, there is no evidence that the 3.5 mg/kg dose is harmful or causes more adverse events to infants in this age group.\n4Current weight-based dosing recommendations are not appropriate for premature infants. Premature infants might have slower clearance of oral oseltamivir because of immature renal function, and doses recommended for full-term infants might lead to very high drug concentrations in this age group. CDC recommends dosing as also recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics (Committee on Infectious Diseases, 2018external icon): limited data from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Collaborative Antiviral Study Group provide the basis for dosing preterm infants using their postmenstrual age (gestational age + chronological age): 1.0 mg/kg/dose, orally, twice daily, for those <38 weeks postmenstrual age; 1.5 mg/kg/dose, orally, twice daily, for those 38 through 40 weeks postmenstrual age; 3.0 mg/kg/dose, orally, twice daily, for those >40 weeks postmenstrual age.\n5See Special Considerations for Institutional Settings section below for details regarding duration of chemoprophylaxis for outbreaks in institutional settings.\n6Inhaled zanamivir is approved for treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza within 2 days of illness onset with twice-daily dosing in people 7 years and older, and for chemoprophylaxis with once-daily dosing in people 5 years and older.\n7Intravenous peramivir is approved for treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza within 2 days of illness onset with a single dose in people 2 years and older. Daily dosing for a minimum of 5 days was used in clinical trials of hospitalized patients with influenza (de Jong, 2014external icon, Ison, 2014external icon).\n8There are no data for use of peramivir for chemoprophylaxis of influenza. One study of baloxavir post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) of influenza in household members aged 12 years and older (73% received baloxavir within 24 hours of onset of symptoms in the index household case who received antiviral treatment) reported that the risk of laboratory-confirmed influenza was significantly lower, by 86%, among those who received baloxavir PEP than among those who received placebo (1.9% [7 of 374] vs. 13.6% [51 of 375]; adjusted risk ratio, 0.14; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.06 to 0.30; P<0.001) (Ikematsu, 2020external icon).\n9Oral baloxavir marboxil is approved by the FDA for treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza within 2 days of illness onset in people 12 years and older who are otherwise healthy, or at high risk of developing influenza-related complications.\u00a0 (Baloxavir marboxil (Xofluza)\u00a0pdf icon[package insert]external icon. U.S. Food and Drug Administration website; 2019). Baloxavir marboxil should not be administered with dairy products, calcium-fortified beverages, polyvalent cation-containing laxatives, antacids or oral supplements (e.g., calcium, iron, magnesium, selenium, or zinc); co-administration with polyvalent cation-containing products may decrease plasma concentrations of baloxavir which may reduce efficacy. There are no available published data from clinical trials for baloxavir treatment of influenza in patients who are pregnant, immunocompromised, have severe disease, or in hospitalized patients. A randomized clinical trialexternal icon\u00a0of baloxavir treatment of influenza in hospitalized patients 12 years and older is in-progress.\n\n\n\n\nDuration of Treatment or Chemoprophylaxis\n\n\n\n\nTreatment:\u00a0Recommended duration for antiviral treatment is 5 days for oral oseltamivir or inhaled zanamivir. For the treatment of uncomplicated influenza with intravenous peramivir or oral baloxavir, a single dose is recommended. Longer daily dosing (oral oseltamivir or intravenous peramivir) can be considered for patients who remain severely ill after 5 days of treatment.\nChemoprophylaxis: Recommended duration is 7 days (after last known exposure). For control of outbreaks in institutional settings (e.g., long-term care facilities for elderly people and children) and hospitals, CDC recommends antiviral chemoprophylaxis with oral oseltamivir or inhaled zanamivir for a minimum of 2 weeks and continuing up to 1 week after the last known case was identified. Antiviral chemoprophylaxis is recommended for all residents, including those who have received influenza vaccination. Baloxavir is approved for post-exposure prophylaxis (single-dose) of influenza in persons aged 12 years and older.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nChemoprophylaxis\n\n\n\n\nAnnual influenza vaccinationpdf icon is the best way to prevent influenza because vaccination can be given well before influenza virus exposures occur and can provide safe and effective immunity throughout the influenza season.\nNeuraminidase inhibitor antiviral medications are approximately\u00a070%\u00a0to\u00a090%\u00a0effective in preventing influenza against susceptible influenza viruses and are useful adjuncts to influenza vaccination.\nCDC does not recommend widespread or routine use of antiviral medications for chemoprophylaxis except as one of multiple interventions to control institutional influenza outbreaks. Routine use of post-exposure chemoprophylaxis is not recommended; one reason for this is to avoid sub-therapeutic treatment dosing if infection is already established, although the likelihood of emergence of antiviral resistant viruses is unknown.\n\nClinicians may wish to also consult the antiviral chemoprophylaxis recommendations from the Infectious Diseases Society of America (Uyeki, 2019external icon).\n\n\nIn general, CDC does not recommend seasonal or pre-exposure antiviral chemoprophylaxis, but\u00a0antiviral medications can be considered for chemoprophylaxis to prevent influenza in certain situations, such as the following examples:\n\nPrevention of influenza in people at high risk of influenza complications during the first two weeks following vaccination after exposure to a person with influenza.\nPrevention for people at high risk for complications from influenza who cannot receive influenza vaccine due to a contraindication after exposure to a person with influenza.\nPrevention for people with severe immune deficiencies or others who might not respond to influenza vaccination, such as people receiving immunosuppressive medications, after exposure to a person with influenza.\nPatients receiving antiviral chemoprophylaxis should be encouraged to seek medical evaluation as soon as they develop a febrile respiratory illness that might indicate influenza.\n\n\nAn emphasis on close monitoring and early initiation of antiviral treatment if fever and/or respiratory symptoms develop is an alternative to chemoprophylaxis after a suspected exposure for some people.\nTo be effective as chemoprophylaxis, an antiviral medication must be taken each day for the duration of potential exposure to a person with influenza and continued for 7 days after the last known exposure. For people taking antiviral chemoprophylaxis after inactivated influenza vaccination, the recommended duration is until immunity after vaccination develops (antibody development after vaccination takes about two weeks in adults and can take longer in children depending on age and vaccination history).\nAntiviral chemoprophylaxis generally is not recommended if more than 48 hours have elapsed since the first exposure to a person with influenza.\nPatients receiving antiviral chemoprophylaxis should be encouraged to seek medical evaluation as soon as they develop a febrile respiratory illness that might indicate influenza.\n\n\n\n\nDosing in Adult Patients with Renal Impairment\n\n\n\nDose adjustment of oseltamivir is recommended for patients with creatinine clearance between 10 and 60 mL/min and patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) undergoing hemodialysis or continuous peritoneal dialysis receiving oseltamivir for the treatment or chemoprophylaxis of influenza. Oseltamivir is not recommended for patients with ESRD not undergoing dialysis. The recommended doses are detailed in Table 3; duration of treatment and chemoprophylaxis is the same as recommended for patients with normal renal function. The dose of intravenous peramivir should be reduced for patients with baseline creatinine clearance below 50 mL/min (see Table 3).\nNo dose adjustment is recommended for inhaled zanamivir for a 5-day course of treatment for patients with renal impairment. Pharmacokinetic analysis did not identify a clinically meaningful effect of renal function on the pharmacokinetics of baloxavir in patients with creatinine clearance 50 mL/min and above. The effects of severe renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of baloxavir marboxil or its active metabolite, baloxavir, have not been evaluated.\n\n\n\nTable 3.

Avoid co-administration of baloxavir with polyvalent cation-containing laxatives, antacids, or oral supplements (e.g., calcium, iron, magnesium, selenium, or zinc).\nConcurrent administration of antiviral drugs with intranasal live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) may inhibit viral replication of LAIV and thereby decrease the effectiveness of LAIV vaccination. LAIV should not be given if oseltamivir or zanamivir was administered within 48 hours of planned vaccination, or if peramivir was administered within 5 days of planned vaccination, or if baloxavir was administered within 17 days of planned vaccination. If LAIV is given, and antiviral medications are subsequently administered up to two weeks after vaccination, the effectiveness of LAIV might be reduced, and persons who receive these antiviral medications within two weeks after receiving LAIV should be revaccinated with another appropriate influenza vaccine (e.g., IIV or RIV4).\n\nFor more information, visit the\u00a0Seasonal Influenza (Flu)\u00a0site, email\u00a0CDC-INFO, or call CDC at 800-CDC-INFO (English and Spanish) or 888-232-6348 (TTY).\n\nTop of PageResourcesDiagnostic Testing for InfluenzaMore information for clinicians on influenza diagnostic testing is available.\nMoreInformation on Influenza ActivityClinicians should contact their local or state health department for information about current local influenza activity.\u00a0CDC\u2019s FluView report gives Information regarding national influenza activity weekly during influenza season.\nMoreReferencesA more complete list of influenza antiviral references is available.\nMore", "reports": [{"diseases": ["sars", "COVID-19"], "syndromes": ["Influenza-like illness"], "event_date": "2009-03-23 00:00:00", "locations": [null, 6255150, 3426543, 11139890, 4634482, 6251796, 1637624, 2759197]}]}{"url": "https://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/diagnosis/table-flu-covid19-detection.html", "date_of_publication": "", "headline": "Table 4.

The composition of U.S. flu vaccines is reviewed annually and updated as needed to match circulating flu viruses. Flu vaccines protect against the three or four viruses (depending on the vaccine) that research suggests will be most common.\nFor 2020-2021, trivalent (three-component) egg-based vaccines are recommended to contain:\n\nA/Guangdong-Maonan/SWL1536/2019 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus (updated)\nA/Hong Kong/2671/2019 (H3N2)-like virus (updated)\nB/Washington/02/2019 (B/Victoria lineage)-like virus (updated)\n\nQuadrivalent (four-component) egg-based vaccines, which protect against a second lineage of B viruses, are recommended to contain:\n\nthe three recommended viruses above, plus B/Phuket/3073/2013-like (Yamagata lineage) virus.\n\nFor 2020-2021, cell- or recombinant-based vaccines are recommended to contain:\n\nA/Hawaii/70/2019 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus (updated)\nA/Hong Kong/45/2019 (H3N2)-like virus (updated)\nB/Washington/02/2019 (B/Victoria lineage)-like virus (updated)\nB/Phuket/3073/2013-like (Yamagata lineage) virus\n\n Are there any changes to the 2020-2021 Northern Hemisphere vaccines from what was included in this season\u2019s 2019-2020 U.S. flu vaccines?Yes, this season\u2019s flu vaccines were updated to better match viruses expected to be circulating in the United States.\n\nThe egg-based H1N1 vaccine component was updated from an A/Brisbane/02/2018 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus to an A/Guangdong-Maonan/SWL1536/2019 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus.\nThe cell- or recombinant-based H1N1 vaccine component was updated from an A/Brisbane/02/2018 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus to an A/Hawaii/70/2019 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus.\nThe egg-based H3N2 vaccine component was updated from an A/Kansas/14/2017 (H3N2)-like virus to an A/Hong Kong/2671/2019 (H3N2)-like virus.\nThe cell- or recombinant-based H3N2 vaccine component was updated from an A/Kansas/14/2017 (H3N2)-like virus to an A/Hong Kong/45/2019 (H3N2)-like virus.\nThe B/Victoria lineage vaccine component was updated from a B/Colorado/06/2017 (B/Victoria lineage)-like virus to a B/Washington/02/2019 (B/Victoria lineage)-like virus.\nThe B/Yamagata lineage vaccine component was not updated.\n\nAre there any new vaccines licensed for use during the 2020-2021 flu season?\nThere are two new vaccines licensed for use during the 2020-2021 flu season.\n\nThe first is a quadrivalent high-dose vaccine licensed for use in adults 65 years and older. This vaccine will replace the previously licensed trivalent high-dose vaccine.\n\nThe second new vaccine that will be available is a quadrivalent adjuvanted vaccine licensed for use in adults 65 years and older.\n\nThis vaccine is similar to the previously licensed trivalent vaccine containing MF59 adjuvant, but it has one additional influenza B component.\n\nMore information about new vaccines available this year. What flu vaccines are recommended this season?For the 2020-2021 flu season, providers may choose to administer any licensed, age-appropriate flu vaccine (IIV, RIV4, or LAIV4) with no preference for any one vaccine over another.\nVaccine options this season include:\n\nStandard dose flu shots.\nHigh-dose shots for people 65 years and older.\nShots made with adjuvant for people 65 years and older.\nShots made with virus grown in cell culture. No eggs are involved in the production of this vaccine.\nShots made using a vaccine production technology (recombinant vaccine) that do not require having a candidate vaccine virus (CVV) sample to produce.\nLive attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV). \u2013 A vaccine made with attenuated (weakened) live virus that is given by nasal spray.\n\n Do we need to get a flu vaccine earlier this year (i.e. July/August)?There is no change in CDC\u2019s recommendation on timing of vaccination this flu season. Getting vaccinated in July or August is too early, especially for older people, because of the likelihood of reduced protection against flu infection later in the flu season. September and October are good times to get vaccinated. However, as long as flu viruses are circulating, vaccination should continue, even in January or later.\nMore information for vaccination timing this year. Will there be changes in how and where flu vaccine is given this fall and winter?How and where people get a flu vaccine may need to change due to the COVID-19 pandemic. CDC works with healthcare providers and state and local health departments to develop contingency plans on how to vaccinate people against flu without increasing their risk of exposure to respiratory germs, like the virus that causes COVID-19, and has released Interim Guidance for Immunization Services During the COVID-19 Pandemic. More information is available in the \u2018Administering Flu Vaccines during the COVID-19 Pandemic\u2019 section below.\nSome settings that usually provide flu vaccine, like workplaces, may not offer vaccination this upcoming season, because of the challenges with maintaining social distancing. For more information on where you can get a flu vaccine, visit\u00a0www.vaccinefinder.orgexternal iconexternal icon. Information on getting a flu vaccine safely this season is available in the \u2018Getting a Flu Vaccine during the COVID-19 Pandemic\u2019 section below. How many flu vaccines are expected to be available for the 2020-2021 flu season?Flu vaccine is produced by private manufacturers, so supply depends on manufacturers. For the 2020-2021 season, manufacturers have projected they will provide as many as 194-198 million doses of flu vaccine, which is more than the 175 million dose record set during the 2019-2020 flu season. Are there delays in the availability of flu vaccine?Currently, influenza vaccine manufacturers are not reporting any significant delays in national flu vaccine supply or distribution this season.\nInfluenza vaccine production and distribution in the US are primarily private sector endeavors. CDC encourages manufacturers and distributors to use a distribution strategy in which providers receive smaller shipments to allow as many providers as possible to begin vaccination activities early in the vaccination season. Ideally, the intervals between shipments are short so that each provider has a continuous supply and can continue vaccinating patients without interruption. While no significant delays have been reported, in some places, robust demand for vaccine and supplies required to support flu vaccination efforts, like needles or syringes, may mean that some providers run out of vaccine or other supplies before their next shipment has arrived. While an allocation system can initially limit the size of individual orders, as supplies become available in increasing numbers, supply is expected to catch up with demand. Additionally, because vaccine manufacturing has been extended to support the production of a record number of flu vaccine doses this year, providers are likely to receive more shipments throughout the season.\nTo make sure your provider has flu vaccine available, call ahead to confirm availability. There also may be other locations in your area that have vaccine available. Use the VaccineFinderexternal icon to find out where to get vaccinated near you.\nCDC will continue to provide weekly updates on total flu vaccine doses distributed throughout the 2020-2021 flu season. Are there enough doses of flu vaccine available for the 2020-2021 flu season?Vaccine manufactures have said that they will produce between 194 and 198 million doses of flu vaccine this season. While this isn\u2019t enough for every person in the U.S. to receive a flu vaccine this season, not everyone chooses to get vaccinated. For example, last season, only about half of Americans chose to get a flu vaccine and, in general, there are many doses of flu vaccine that go unused every season.\nThat said, demand for flu vaccine may be greater this season because of the COVID-19 pandemic. And while it would be unusual, it is possible that all flu vaccines will be used this season. CDC\u2019s goal is for every available dose of flu vaccine to be used to protect people from flu. To make sure your provider has flu vaccine available, call ahead. There also may be other locations in your area that have vaccine available. Use the VaccineFinderexternal icon to find out where to get vaccinated near you.\nCDC will continue to provide weekly updates on total flu vaccine doses distributed throughout the 2020-2021 flu season. What should someone 65 or older do who is having trouble finding high-dose flu vaccine?CDC does not have a preferential recommendation for any flu vaccine over another, and vaccination should not be delayed to wait on a specific vaccine product when another vaccine licensed for use in adults is available.\nThere are several flu vaccine formulations that are approved for use in people 65 and older, including two so-called \u201cenhanced\u201d flu vaccines: the high dose flu vaccine and the adjuvanted flu vaccine. Both vaccines are specifically designed to create a stronger immune response in people aged 65 years and older.\nAnother recent studyexternal icon showed that a vaccine made using recombinant technology can also produce a stronger immune response in adults 65 years and older.\nFor those having trouble locating \u201cenhanced\u201d vaccines licensed for use in people 65 years and older, call providers ahead of time to check availability. There also may be other locations in your area that have vaccine available. Use VaccineFinderexternal icon to find out where to get vaccinated near you.\nHow to locate high-dose and adjuvanted flu vaccine using VaccineFinder:\n\nVisit VaccineFinder.orgexternal icon\nClick \u201cFind Vaccines\u201d\nClick \u201cSelect your vaccines\u201d\nSelect \u201cFlu Shot (65+)\u201d and then click \u201cAdd 1 Vaccine\u201d\nEnter your address or zip code\nClick \u201cSearch For Vaccine\u201d\nChoose a vaccine provider from the list that appears or choose an option from the map.\nCall ahead to confirm availability and then get your flu vaccine from your chosen provider.\n\n What if my vaccine provider doesn't have my preferred flu vaccine?CDC recommends use of any licensed, age-appropriate influenza vaccine during the 2020-2021 influenza season, including inactivated influenza vaccine, high-dose influenza vaccine, adjuvanted influenza vaccine, or recombinant flu vaccine.\nVaccination should not be delayed to wait on a specific vaccine product when another age-appropriate vaccine is available. What should vaccine providers do if they are experiencing problems with purchasing needles for flu vaccination?No widespread needle shortages or supply interruptions have been reported. Adequate supplies are expected to be available to support both the 2020\u20132021 influenza vaccination program and routine vaccination efforts. However, due to high demand for influenza vaccination in some locations, there may be some limited or temporarily unavailable supplies of specific types of needles and needle/syringe sets. CDC has developed a resource guide\u00a0for providers who are experiencing problems with purchasing needles for influenza and routine vaccinations. Flu and COVID-19What is the difference between Influenza (Flu) and COVID-19?Influenza (Flu) and COVID-19 are both contagious respiratory illnesses, but they are caused by different viruses. COVID-19 is caused by infection with a new coronavirus (called SARS-CoV-2) and flu is caused by infection with\u00a0influenza viruses. Because some of the symptoms of flu and COVID-19 are similar, it may be hard to tell the difference between them based on symptoms alone, and testing may be needed to help confirm a diagnosis.\nCOVID-19 seems to spread more easily than flu and causes more serious illnesses in some people. It can also take longer before people show symptoms and people can be contagious for longer.\nWhile more is learned every day, there is still a lot that is unknown about COVID-19 and the virus that causes it. This page\u00a0compares COVID-19 and flu, given the best available information to date.\nTo learn more about COVID-19, visit Coronavirus (COVID-19).\nTo learn more about flu, visit Influenza (Flu). Will there be flu along with COVID-19 in the fall and winter?While it\u2019s not possible to say with certainty what will happen in the fall and winter, CDC believes it\u2019s likely that flu viruses and the virus that causes COVID-19 will both be spreading. In this context, getting a flu vaccine will be more important than ever. CDC recommends that all people 6 months and older get a yearly flu vaccine. Can I have flu and COVID-19 at the same time?Yes. It is possible have flu, as well as other respiratory illnesses, and COVID-19 at the same time. Health experts are still studying how common this can be.\nSome of the symptoms of flu and COVID-19 are similar, making it hard to tell the difference between them based on symptoms alone. Diagnostic testing\u00a0can help determine if you are sick with flu or COVID-19. Is there a test that can detect both flu and COVID-19?Yes. CDC has developed a test that will check for A and B type seasonal flu viruses and SARS CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. This test will be used by U.S. public health laboratories. Testing for these viruses at the same time will give public health officials important information about how flu and COVID-19 are spreading and what prevention steps should be taken. The test will also help public health laboratories save time and testing materials, and to possibly return test results faster.\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has given CDC an Emergency Use Authorizationexternal iconexternal icon\u00a0for this new test. Initial test kits were sent to public health laboratories in early August 2020. CDC will continue to manufacture and distribute these kits.\nMore information for laboratories is available. Will the new test that detects both flu and COVID-19 replace other tests?No. This new test is designed for use at CDC-supported public health laboratories at state and local levels, where it will supplement and streamline surveillance for flu and COVID-19. The use of this specialized test will be focused on public health surveillance efforts and will not replace any COVID-19 tests currently used in commercial laboratories, hospitals, clinics, and other healthcare settings.\nCDC\u2019s first viral test for SARS-CoV-2 (the CDC 2019-nCoV Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel (ER-34)) will still be available for qualified laboratories to order through the International Reagent Resource (IRR)external iconexternal icon. The new multiplex assay\u00a0can also be ordered through the IRR. Check the IRR website for details.\nFor additional questions, please visit: Clinical Questions about COVID-19: Questions and Answers: Testing, Diagnosis, and Notification Is COVID-19 more dangerous than flu?Flu and COVID-19 can both result in serious illness, including illness resulting in hospitalization or death. While there is still much to learn about COVID-19, recent studies show it does seem as if COVID-19 is more deadly than seasonal influenza. Will a flu vaccine protect me against COVID-19?Getting a flu vaccine will not protect against COVID-19, however flu vaccination has many other important benefits. Flu vaccines have been shown to reduce the risk of flu illness, hospitalization and death. Getting a flu vaccine this fall will be more important than ever, not only to reduce your risk from flu but also to help conserve potentially scarce health care resources. Does a flu vaccination increase your risk of getting COVID-19?There is no evidence that getting a flu vaccination increases your risk of getting sick from a coronavirus, like the one that causes COVID-19.\nYou may have heard about a studyexternal iconexternal icon\u00a0published in January 2020 that reported an association between flu vaccination and risk of four commonly circulating seasonal coronaviruses, but not the one that causes COVID-19. This report was later found to be incorrect.\nThe results from that initial study led researchers in Canada to look at their data to see if they could find similar results in their population. The results from Canada\u2019s studyexternal iconexternal icon\u00a0showed that flu vaccination did not increase risk for these seasonal coronaviruses. The Canadian findings highlighted the protective benefits of flu vaccination.\nThe Canadian researchers also identified a flaw in the methods of the first study, noting that it violated the part of study design that compares vaccination rates among patients with and without flu (test negative design). This flaw led to the incorrect association between flu vaccination and seasonal coronavirus risk. When these researchers reexamined data from the first study using correct methods, they found that flu vaccination did not increase risk for infection with other respiratory viruses, including seasonal coronaviruses. What is CDC doing to promote flu vaccination during the COVID-19 pandemic?To address the importance of influenza vaccination, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, CDC will maximize flu vaccination by increasing availability of vaccine, including purchasing an additional 2 million doses of pediatric flu vaccine and 9.3 million doses of adult flu vaccine, by emphasizing the importance of flu vaccination for the entire flu season, and by conducting targeted communication outreach to specific groups who are at higher risk for complications from flu. These same groups are often at higher risk for COVID-19 too, so protecting them from influenza is important to decrease their risk of co-infection. Communication strategies for providers and the public will include:\n\nEducational outreach activities by CDC, including social media, press conferences, web page spotlights, radio media tours, op-eds, and other publications,\nA digital campaign to educate the general public and people with who are at increased risk from influenza and COVID-19 complications,\nSpecial educational efforts to inform the general population, people with underlying health conditions, and African American and Hispanic audiences about the importance of flu vaccination, and\nUpdated vaccination websites for the public and providers that highlight the safety precautions being implemented in healthcare facilities during the pandemic.\n\n If I get sick with flu, am I at higher risk of contracting COVID-19?Because COVID-19 is still a relatively new illness, there is little data on how flu illness affects the risk of getting COVID-19. In general, getting sick with one virus, like flu, doesn\u2019t affect being infected with another, like the virus that causes COVID-19. \u00a0We do know that people can be infected with flu viruses and the virus that causes COVID-19 at the same time. Getting a flu vaccine can reduce your risk of getting flu. Because the symptoms of flu and COVID-19 are similar, how will I know if I have flu or COVID-19?Although there are some differences between flu and COVID-19, they also share signs and symptoms. For this reason, it may be hard to tell the difference between them based on symptoms alone. Testing may be needed to help confirm a diagnosis. Get more information on symptoms of COVID-19 and flu. I think I may have flu. Is it safe for me to visit my health care provider during the COVID-19 pandemic?Providers may have different procedures and practices for evaluating and treating flu during the COVID-19 pandemic. If you have flu symptoms and are at high risk of serious flu complications, you should call your health care provider as soon as possible to tell them about your symptoms. Your provider may decide to treat you with flu antiviral medications. Follow your health care provider\u2019s and CDC\u2019s recommendations for doctor visits. Continue to take everyday preventive actions. Getting a Flu Vaccine during the COVID-19 PandemicIf coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is spreading in my community, should I still go out to get a flu vaccine?Yes. Getting a flu vaccine is an essential part of protecting your health and your family\u2019s health this season. To protect your health when getting a flu vaccine, follow CDC\u2019s recommendations for running essential errands and doctor visits. Continue to take everyday preventive actions. How can I safely get a flu vaccine if COVID-19 is spreading in my community?When going to get a flu vaccine, practice everyday preventive actions and follow CDC recommendations for running essential errands.\nAsk your doctor, pharmacist, or health department if they are following CDC\u2019s vaccination pandemic guidance. Any vaccination location following CDC\u2019s guidance should be a safe place for you to get a flu vaccine. If I am at high risk for serious illness from COVID-19 or flu, where is the safest place for me to get a flu vaccine?You can safely get a flu vaccine at multiple locations including your doctor\u2019s office, health departments, and pharmacies. You can use\u00a0VaccineFinder.orgexternal iconexternal icon\u00a0to find where flu vaccines are available near you. When going to get a flu vaccine, be sure to practice everyday preventive actions.\nAsk your doctor, pharmacist, or health department if they are following CDC\u2019s vaccination pandemic guidance. Any vaccination location following CDC\u2019s guidance should be a safe place for you to get a flu vaccine.\n\n\nVaccination of people at high risk\u00a0for flu complications is especially important to decrease their risk of severe flu illness. Many people at higher risk from flu also seem to be at higher risk from COVID-19. If you are at high risk, it is especially important for you to get a flu vaccine this year.\n\n\n Why do I need a flu vaccine if I am wearing a mask and social distancing?Wearing a mask and social distancing can help protect you and others from respiratory viruses, like flu and COVID-19, but best way to prevent flu illness is for everyone 6 months and older to be vaccinated each year. Flu activity is low in my community right now; should I wait to get a flu vaccine?No, you should not delay getting a flu vaccine. While flu activity may be low in your community now, it could begin increasing at any time. Remember, it takes about two weeks after vaccination to develop antibodies that provide protection against flu. Ideally, you should get vaccinated before flu viruses begin circulating in your community. Everyone 6 months and older should get a flu vaccine each year. Can I get a flu vaccine if I have COVID-19 or if I think I have been exposed to someone with COVID-19?For people who are sick with COVID-19 and who are already in a medical setting (for example, are in a hospital or other health care setting), flu vaccination should be deferred until they are no longer acutely ill.\n\u00a0For those who are sick with COVID-19 or think they might have COVID-19, it is important to stay home and stay away from other people, unless medical care is required. Those who are not in a medical care setting (for example, are isolating at home), should wait until they meet criteria for leaving isolation (even if they have no symptoms) to come to a vaccination setting in order to avoid spreading COVID-19 to others in the vaccination setting. CDC has guidance for when you can be around others after having COVID-19. Are there special precautions my doctor, pharmacist, or health department should take this flu season to make sure flu vaccines can be given safely during the COVID-19 pandemic?Yes. CDC has resources to help with vaccine planning during the COVID-19 pandemic. Ask your doctor, pharmacist, or health department if they are following CDC\u2019s vaccination pandemic guidance. \u00a0And protect yourself by practicing everyday preventive actions. I don\u2019t have a primary care provider, where can I get a flu vaccine?If you don\u2019t have a doctor that you regularly see, flu vaccines are also available at locations including health departments and pharmacies. You can use\u00a0VaccineFinder.orgexternal iconexternal icon\u00a0to find where flu vaccines are available near you. Can I get a COVID-19 vaccine and flu vaccine at the same time?No. You should not get a COVID-19 vaccine and a flu vaccine at the same time. COVID-19 vaccines should be given alone with at least 14 days either before or after you get any other vaccines, including a flu vaccine. This is because there is currently limited information on the safety and effectiveness of getting other vaccines at the same time as a COVID-19 vaccine.\nAs more information becomes available, this recommendation may change. Your healthcare provider can help you decide the best vaccination schedule for you and your family. Flu ActivityWill new flu viruses circulate this season?Flu viruses are constantly changing so it\u2019s not unusual for new flu viruses to appear each year. More information about how flu viruses change\u00a0is available. When will flu activity begin and when will it peak?The timing of flu is difficult to predict and can vary in different parts of the country and from season to season. Are there any updates in the methods for flu surveillance for the upcoming season?For the 2020-2021 flu season, there are some changes to FluView surveillance methodology.\nThis season, in addition to state-level data, the influenza-like-illness (ILI) activity map will display ILI activity by Core-based Statistical Areas (CBSA), a U.S. geographic area defined by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) that consists of one or more counties (or equivalents) anchored by an urban center of at least 10,000 people plus adjacent counties that are socioeconomically tied to the urban center by commuting.\nAlso, during most flu seasons, state and territorial health departments report the level of geographic spread of flu activity in their jurisdictions each week through the\u00a0State and Territorial Epidemiologists Report. However, due to the impact of COVID-19 on ILI surveillance, and the facts that the state and territorial epidemiologists report relies heavily on ILI activity, reporting for this system will be suspended for the 2020-21 influenza season.\nFinally, NCHS collects death certificate data for all deaths occurring in the United States, and these data are aggregated by the week of death occurrence. In previous flu seasons, the NCHS surveillance data were used to calculate the percent of all deaths occurring each week that had pneumonia and/or influenza (P&I) listed as a cause of death. Because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, COVID-19 coded deaths were added to P&I to create the PIC (pneumonia, influenza, and/or COVID-19) classification. PIC includes all deaths with pneumonia, influenza, and/or COVID-19 listed on the death certificate.\nMore information on flu surveillance methodology and these updates is available online. Flu Vaccine CoverageWhat vaccine uptake estimates will CDC provide this season?CDC has developed a new Weekly National Influenza Vaccination Dashboard designed to share preliminary, in-season, weekly influenza vaccination coverage estimates and related data.\nThe dashboard will include information on the number of influenza vaccine doses distributed in the United States, weekly flu vaccination coverage rates for children 6 months \u2013 17 years old, monthly flu vaccination coverage rates among pregnant persons, and information on how many flu vaccines have been administered in pharmacies and doctor\u2019s offices.\nThe data will be updated weekly or monthly, depending on the data source, throughout the 2020-2021 influenza season; other data sources will be added as they become available. Visit the National Influenza Vaccination Dashboard for more information.\n\u00a0\nCDC also provides seasonal flu vaccination coverage estimates at the end of a flu season. However, those estimates are not usually available until several months after the flu season ends. How is CDC tracking weekly flu vaccination coverage among children 6 months \u2013 17 years old?Influenza vaccination coverage among children is assessed through the\u00a0National Immunization Survey-Flu\u00a0(NIS-Flu), which provides weekly influenza vaccination coverage estimates for children 6 months\u201317 years old. NIS-Flu is a national random-digit-dialed cellular telephone survey of households conducted during the flu season (October-June). Additional information about NIS-Flu methods and estimates from 2019-2020 season are available at FluVaxView. How is CDC tracking monthly flu vaccination coverage among pregnant women?Monthly flu vaccination coverage estimates among pregnant women are based on electronic health record (EHR) data from the\u00a0Vaccine Safety Datalink\u00a0(VSD), a collaboration between CDC\u2019s Immunization Safety Office and nine integrated health care organizations. Of note, because these estimates are based on data from nine integrated health care systems, they may not be representative of all pregnant women in the U.S. How is CDC tracking the number of flu vaccines administered at pharmacies and doctor\u2019s offices?CDC is tracking the number of flu vaccines administered at pharmacies and doctor\u2019s offices by utilizing new sources of vaccination data, including IQVIAexternal icon\u00a0data for vaccinations administered in retail pharmacies (e.g., \u00a0chain, mass merchandise, food stores, and independent pharmacies) and doctor\u2019s offices. When will the first flu vaccine uptake estimates be provided for this season?CDC will launch the first weekly FluVaxView dashboard in December. The number of flu vaccine doses distributed, vaccination coverage estimates for children, and vaccinations administered in retail pharmacies and doctor\u2019s offices will be updated weekly. Coverage estimates for pregnant women will be updated monthly. Visit the National Influenza Vaccination Dashboard for more information. Is this the same kind of vaccine uptake information that has been provided in the past?Each flu season since 2009-2010, CDC has estimated annual influenza vaccination coverage for the United States by utilizing data from several nationally representative surveys: the\u00a0Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System\u00a0(BRFSS), the\u00a0National Health Interview Survey\u00a0(NHIS), and the\u00a0National Immunization Survey-Flu (NIS-Flu). Internet panel surveys of\u00a0adults,\u00a0health care personnel, and\u00a0pregnant women\u00a0are also used.\nClick here for vaccination coverage estimates from past flu season. CDC will continue to provide end of season estimates of influenza vaccination coverage from these data sources.\n\u00a0\nFor the 2020-21 flu season, CDC will provide weekly updates on the number of flu vaccine doses distributed, vaccination coverage estimates for children, and the number of doses administered in pharmacies and doctor\u2019s offices. Coverage estimates for pregnant women and will be updated monthly. Is CDC working to improve influenza vaccine uptake data?CDC is exploring non-survey data sources, such as claims and other administrative data, to track flu vaccination coverage. \u00a0For example, CDC is exploring ways to estimate within-season influenza vaccination coverage among adults using data on the number of doses administered in pharmacies and doctor\u2019s offices and estimates of the proportion of all influenza vaccinations that are received in these settings.\u00a0 CDC supports state and local jurisdictions in use of their immunization information systems to assess influenza vaccination coverage at the jurisdictional level. Administering Flu Vaccines During the COVID-19 PandemicIs there guidance for safely administering vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic?CDC has released Interim Guidance for Immunization Services During the COVID-19 Pandemic. This guidance is intended to help immunization providers in a variety of clinical and alternative settings with the safe administration of vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic. This guidance will be continually reassessed and updated based on the evolving epidemiology of COVID-19 in the United States. Healthcare providers who give vaccines should also consult guidance from state, local, tribal, and territorial health officials.\nFor the complete interim guidance for immunization services during the COVID-19 pandemic. Why is it important for influenza (flu) vaccines to be given during the COVID-19 pandemic?Efforts to reduce the spread of COVID-19, such as stay-at-home and shelter-in-place orders, have led to decreased use of routine preventive medical services, including immunization services. Ensuring that people continue or start getting routine vaccinations during the COVID-19 pandemic is essential for protecting people and communities from vaccine-preventable diseases and outbreaks, including flu. Routine vaccination prevents illnesses that lead to unnecessary medical visits and hospitalizations, which further strain the healthcare system.\nFor the upcoming flu season, flu vaccination will be very important to reduce flu because it can help reduce the overall impact of respiratory illnesses on the population and thus lessen the resulting burden on the healthcare system during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nA flu vaccine may also provide several individual health benefits, including keeping you from getting sick with flu, reducing the severity of your illness if you do get flu and reducing your risk of a flu-associated hospitalization. Who should get their flu vaccine during the COVID-19 pandemic?Annual flu vaccination is recommended\u00a0for everyone 6 months of age and older, with rare exceptions, because it is an effective way to decrease flu illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, reducing the overall burden of respiratory illnesses is important to protect vulnerable populations at risk for severe illness, the healthcare system, and other critical infrastructure. Thus, healthcare providers should use every opportunity during the influenza vaccination season to administer influenza vaccines to all eligible persons, including;\n\nEssential workers: Including healthcare personnel (including nursing home, long-term care facility, and pharmacy staff) and other critical infrastructure\u00a0workforce\nPersons at increased risk for\u00a0severe illness from COVID-19: Including adults aged 65 years and older, residents in a nursing home or long-term care facility, and persons of all ages with certain underlying medical conditions. Severe illness from COVID-19 has been observed to disproportionately affect members of certain racial/ethnic minority groups\nPersons at increased risk for serious influenza complications: Including infants and young children, children with neurologic conditions, pregnant women, adults aged 65 years and older, and other persons with certain underlying medical conditions\n\n Should a flu vaccine be given to someone with suspected or confirmed COVID-19?No. Vaccination should be deferred (postponed) for people with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, regardless of whether they have symptoms, until they have met the criteria\u00a0to discontinue their isolation. While mild illness is not a contraindication to flu vaccination, vaccination visits for these people should be postponed to avoid exposing healthcare personnel and other patients to the virus that causes COVID-19. When scheduling or confirming appointments for vaccination, patients should be instructed to notify the provider\u2019s office or clinic in advance if they currently have or develop any symptoms of COVID-19.\nAdditionally, a prior infection with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 or flu does not protect someone from future flu infections. The best way to prevent seasonal flu is to get vaccinated every year. What steps can healthcare personnel take to safely give flu vaccine during the COVID-19 pandemic?The potential for asymptomatic spread of the virus that causes COVID-19 underscores the importance of applying infection prevention practices to encounters with all patients, including physical distancing (at least 6 feet) when possible, respiratory and hand hygiene, surface decontamination, and source control while in a healthcare facility. Immunization providers should refer to the guidance developed to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in healthcare settings, including outpatient and ambulatory care settings.\nTo help ensure the safe delivery of care during vaccination visits, providers should:\n\nMinimize chances for exposures, including steps such as these:\n\nScreen patients for symptoms of COVID-19 and contact with persons with possible COVID-19 prior to\u00a0and upon their arrival at the facility, and isolate symptomatic patients as soon as possible.\nLimit and monitor points of entry to the facility and install barriers, such as clear plastic sneeze guards, to limit physical contact with patients at triage.\nImplement policies for adults and children over the age of 2 years to wear cloth face coverings\u00a0(if tolerated).\nEnsure patients practice respiratory hygiene, cough etiquette, and hand hygiene.\n\n\nEnsure all staff adhere to the following infection prevention and control procedures:\n\nFollow Standard Precautions, which include guidance for hand hygiene and cleaning the environment between patients.\nWear a medical facemask at all times.\nUse eye protection based on level of community transmission\u00a0of the virus that causes COVID-19:\n\nModerate-to-substantial transmission: Healthcare providers should wear eye protection given the increased likelihood of encountering asymptomatic COVID-19 patients.\nMinimal-to-no transmission: Universal eye protection is considered optional, unless otherwise indicated as a part of Standard Precautions.\n\n\n\n\nConsider these additional steps during vaccine administration:\n\nIntranasal or oral vaccines:\n\nHealthcare providers should wear gloves when giving intranasal or oral vaccines because of the increased likelihood of coming into contact with a patient\u2019s mucous membranes and body fluids. They should change their gloves and wash their hands between patients.\nGiving these vaccines is not considered an aerosol-generating procedure\u00a0and thus, the use of an N95 or higher-level respirator is not recommended.\n\n\nIntramuscular or subcutaneous vaccines:\n\nIf healthcare providers wear gloves when administering vaccine, they should change their gloves and wash their hands between patients.\n\n\n\n\nFor patients (sick or well) presenting for care or routine visits, ensure physical distancing by implementing strategies, such as:\n\nSeparating sick from well patients by scheduling these visits during different times of the day (e.g., well visits in the morning and sick visits in the afternoon), placing patients with sick visits in different areas of the facility, or scheduling patients with sick visits in a different location from well visits (when space is available).\nReduce crowding in waiting areas by asking patients to remain outside (e.g., stay in their vehicles, if applicable) until they are called into the facility for their appointment.\nEnsure that physical distancing measures, with separation of at least 6 feet between patients and visitors, are maintained during all aspects of the visit, including check-in, checkout, screening procedures, and postvaccination monitoring. Use strategies such as physical barriers, signs, ropes, and floor markings.\nUse electronic communications as much as possible (e.g., filling out needed paperwork online in advance) to minimize patients\u2019 time in the office as well as their sharing of materials (e.g., clipboards, pens).\n\n\n\n Is there guidance for giving flu vaccine in settings other than a doctor\u2019s office (e.g., pharmacies; temporary, off-site, or satellite clinics; and large-scale influenza clinics)?Yes. Guidance has been developed for giving vaccines at pharmacies, temporary, off-site, or satellite clinicspdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon, and large-scale influenza clinics. Other approaches to vaccination during the COVID-19 pandemic may include drive-through immunization services at fixed sites, curbside clinics, mobile outreach units, and home visits.\nThe general principles outlined for healthcare facilities\u00a0should also be applied to alternative vaccination sites, with additional precautions for physical distancing that are particularly relevant for large-scale clinics, such as:\n\nProviding specific appointment times or other strategies to manage patient flow and avoid crowding.\nEnsuring sufficient staff and resources to help move patients through the clinic as quickly as possible.\nLimiting the overall number of patients at any given time, particularly for populations at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.\nSetting up a one-way flow through the site and using signs, ropes, or other measures to direct patient traffic and ensure physical distancing between patients.\nArranging a separate vaccination area or separate hours for persons at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19, such as older adults and persons with underlying medical conditions, when feasible.\nSelecting a space large enough to ensure a minimum distance of 6 feet between patients in line or in waiting areas for vaccination, between vaccination stations, and in postvaccination monitoring areas (the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends that providers consider observing patients for 15 minutes after vaccinationpdf iconpdf icon\u00a0to decrease the risk for injury should they faint).\n\n When can someone who recovered from COVID-19 receive an influenza vaccine?Influenza vaccination should be deferred until a patient is no longer acutely ill. This may be different for patients who are already being cared for in a medical setting than it is for patients who are isolating at home. In a medical setting, the timing for vaccination is a matter of clinical discretion. In the outpatient setting, in general, patients who are isolating at home should wait until they meet criteria for leaving isolation (even if they have no symptoms) to come to a vaccination setting in order to avoid spreading COVID-19 to others in the vaccination setting. CDC has guidance for when you can be around others after having COVID-19. What is CDC\u2019s recommendation regarding drive-through influenza vaccination clinics?Curbside and drive-through vaccination clinics may provide the best option for staff and patient safety during the COVID-19 pandemic. Read CDC\u2019s guidance on drive-through vaccination clinics. Should we test for COVID-19 or perform COVID-19 screening before giving an influenza vaccine?COVID-19 testing prior to administering an influenza vaccine is not necessary. However, people who are sick and are suspected of having COVID-19 but who are not already in a health care facility should not come to a vaccination clinic or a healthcare facility for an influenza vaccination, in order to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 to others. Expanded guidance for influenza vaccination during the COVID-19 pandemic is available online: Additional Considerations for Influenza Vaccination of Persons in Healthcare Facilities and Congregate Settings During the COVID-19 Pandemic. Can COVID-19 and influenza vaccines be co-administered?No. The COVID-19 vaccines should be administered alone, with a minimum interval of 14 days before or after administration of any other vaccines, including influenza vaccines. This is because of a lack of data on safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccine administered simultaneously with other vaccines. If COVID-19 vaccine is inadvertently administered within 14 days of another vaccine, doses do not need to be repeated for either vaccine.\nThis recommendation may be updated as more safety and efficacy data become available. Testing and Treatment of Respiratory Illness when SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza Viruses are Co-circulatingWhat should we do if we have a patient who is sick with influenza/COVID-19-like symptoms while waiting for diagnostic test results?While waiting on results of testing, sick non-hospitalized persons with respiratory symptoms should self-isolate at home. Even if people test negative for both viruses, they should self-isolate because of the potential for false negative testing results \u2013 depending upon what kind of test was done (antigen test, molecular test) and the level of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza transmission\u00a0 in the community. Persons not hospitalized but who are at high-risk for complications from influenza should get antiviral treatment for influenza as soon as possible.\nFor hospitalized patients, empiric oseltamivir treatment for suspected influenza should be started as soon as possible regardless of illness duration, without waiting for influenza testing results. Get more information on testing and treatment when SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses are co-circulating. I have a patient who has influenza/COVID-19-like symptoms, how should I proceed with testing and treatment?CDC has developed clinical algorithms that can help guide decisions for influenza testing and treatment when SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses are co-circulating. Do influenza antiviral medications have any positive or negative impact on a concurrent COVID-19 infection?Influenza antiviral medications have no activity against SARS-CoV-2 viruses, nor do they interact with medications used for treatment of COVID-19 patients. If a patient who is at high risk for serious influenza complications is diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus co-infection, they should receive influenza antiviral treatment. Flu Surveillance Data UpdatesWhy was pneumonia, influenza, and COVID-19 (PIC) mortality data added to FluView Interactive?CDC monitors flu deaths each week using death certificate data collected by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). During previous flu seasons, NCHS mortality surveillance data were used to calculate the percentage of all U.S. deaths occurring each week that had pneumonia and/or influenza (P&I) listed as a cause of death on the death certificate. However, because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, COVID-19 coded deaths were added to P&I to create the PIC (pneumonia, influenza and/or COVID-19) mortality classification. CDC has displayed PIC mortality in its FluView report since week 40 of 2020. However, in order to make these data more easily downloadable and interactive, CDC incorporated PIC mortality data into its FluView Interactive data dashboard, beginning with the release of the Week 6 (week ending February 13, 2021) FluView report. FluView Interactive\u00a0is an online data dashboard that accompanies the FluView report. Using FluView Interactive, users can download flu data and view this data via detailed, interactive graphs, charts, maps, and other visualizations.

Heyman Service to America Medal for Science and Environment. The Sammies are presented by the Partnership for Public Service, a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization whose mission is to help make the U.S. government more effective.\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar presented the award to Jernigan, saying, \u201cMost of us try to stay away from people with contagious illnesses, but not Dr. Daniel Jernigan, he goes towards them. During his 25 years with CDC, he\u2019s travelled to investigate SARS in Taiwan and MERS in Saudi Arabia. He\u2019s also worked on avian flu in China and the Ebola outbreak in West Africa.\u201d\nJernigan started at CDC in 1994 as an Epidemic Intelligence Service officer (sometimes called a \u201cDisease Detective\u201d) working in the Respiratory Diseases Branch at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention where early on he was asked to investigate a Legionella outbreak. Since that first investigation 25 years ago, Jernigan has gone on to take leadership roles in CDC\u2019s responses to dozens of contagious disease outbreaks both in the United States and around the world. Today, as Influenza Division Director, Jernigan oversees more than 300 scientists, public health experts, and other staff. At the awards ceremony on October 16, Jernigan recognized his colleagues, saying: \u201cThis award recognizes the work of many people at CDC and in the Influenza Division who are not afraid to jump into complicated situations and develop creative solutions. For flu, those innovations have contributed to averting thousands of deaths and tens of thousands of hospitalizations each year, avoiding illnesses that did not need to occur.\u201d\nNancy Messonnier, MD, Director of CDC\u2019s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said that Jernigan\u2019s \u201cability to manage and lead through any crisis with intelligence and humor and camaraderie\u201d makes his presence valuable in any global health crises.\nAnne Schuchat, MD, CDC\u2019s Principal Deputy Director, commends his ability to innovate.\u00a0 \u201c[Dr. Jernigan] is able to see very far ahead to where we need to go and find innovative ways to get there, whether it\u2019s reinventing how we characterize flu viruses or making laboratories more efficient and ready to surge when there\u2019s a pandemic or bad flu season,\u201d she said.\nBut whether Jernigan is looking to solve a problem in real time, or one that has yet to happen, it\u2019s the fact that he\u2019s able to do so every day that keeps him at CDC.\n\u201cThe ability to effect change very quickly and having the tools to do it is what makes it worth it,\u201d he said. \u201cPlus, I get to work with incredible people as well.\u201d\nLearn more about the work Dr. Jernigan and the Influenza Division are doing by visiting\u00a0www.cdc.gov/flu.\nTo learn more about the Samuel J.

The 2009 H1N1 pandemic was estimated to be associated with 151,700 to 575,400 deaths worldwide during the first year it circulated. [1] This H1N1 virus has continued to circulate seasonally to this day. CDC and its many partners have made great strides in the fields of influenza surveillance, prevention, and treatment since 2009, benefiting both the annual response to seasonal flu epidemics, as well as the global capacity to respond to the next pandemic.

Once labs had the CDC test kit and verified that their testing was running properly, they were able to process their own specimens and no longer needed lab confirmation from CDC.\nGene sequencing technology\n\nDuring the pandemic, owing in part to the preparedness work done prior to 2009, CDC and public health laboratories were able to use molecular testing technology, \u201cwith its pinpoint accuracy and revolutionary speed\u201d [2] to detect cases, and monitor the spread of the virus and its characteristics, including watching for emerging drug resistance, for example. In the wake of the 2009 pandemic, numerous retrospective analyses deemed the use of this technology to be one of the response\u2019s key successes [3].\nSince the pandemic, CDC\u2019s ability to map the complete influenza virus genome has improved exponentially, thanks to considerable leaps forward in gene sequencing technology, sometimes referred to as Next Generation Sequencing or Advanced Molecular Detection (AMD) technology. Where previous technologies revealed the genes of the predominant influenza virus in a respiratory specimen, it\u2019s now possible to see the gene sequences of all of the influenza particles in a single specimen, thereby giving deeper insight into how influenza viruses may change, for example, by mutating inside a single patient to become resistant to antiviral drugs.\nIn 2012 CDC\u2019s influenza laboratory transitioned from a characterization-first approach to a sequence-first approach so now all flu viruses undergo full sequencing as a first step when they arrive at CDC. This change has reduced public health response time to flu outbreaks and also served to greatly expand the global repositories of influenza gene sequence data. Meanwhile, ongoing technological improvements by device manufacturers and CDC\u2019s innovative protocols have brought the gene sequencing cost per virus down from about $180.00 in 2012 to $25.00 per virus in 2019, with additional improvements in the works to bring the cost down even further.\nIn 2009, CDC sequenced influenza virus genomes primarily for the identification of vaccine reference viruses. Now, CDC performs \u201cnext generation sequencing\u201d on close to 7,000 influenza viruses annually, and has submitted more than 30,000 flu virus genomes to public databases.\nTop of PageInfluenza public health laboratory tests\nRT-PCR \n\nSince 2009, the widespread adoption by public health laboratories of the testing technique called \u201creal-time Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction\u201d (rRT-PCR) with CDC\u2019s flu rRT-PCR test kits has directly enhanced the nation\u2019s pandemic preparedness in a number of ways. For one, widespread use of both has led to standardization of influenza testing across the nation\u2019s public health laboratories. Relative to the other diagnostic methods widely used by laboratories to reveal the type and subtype of flu virus in a sample, rRT-PCR produces more-reliable results, and produces those results faster than most other laboratory techniques. [4]\nCDC\u2019s primary rRT-PCR test for influenza viruses (called the \u2018CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel\u2019) is an internationally recognized reference method for detection of influenza. This means the performance of other detection methods is often measured against the performance of CDC\u2019s rRT-PCR flu test.\nThe adaptability of the rRT-PCR test allows laboratories to quickly adjust how specimens are processed in outbreak and pandemic situations to avoid backlogs and unnecessary use of resources. CDC provides algorithms that help to ensure that as more specimens are tested, reagents are conserved, thereby maximizing their public health benefit and further reducing the possibility of supply shortages.\nAlthough laboratories have the option of using other rRT-PCR tests, use of the CDC test in lieu of commercially manufactured rRT-PCR tests takes the pressure off individual laboratories of ensuring their tests are able to detect the newest emerging viruses.\nCDC uses gene sequence data to update its influenza diagnostic kits and reagents, which are used around the world by public health laboratories as the gold-standard for detecting influenza, in large part because of CDC\u2019s rapid response in updating the kits and reagents each time a novel virus emerges.\nFor example, in 2012 the U.S. experienced a rapid up-tick in human infections with swine influenza viruses (called variant virus infections) associated with exposure to infected pigs. CDC quickly confirmed the CDC rRT-PCR test kit\u2019s ability to detect those swine viruses appearing in people, and then issued\u00a0guidance to laboratories on how to interpret rRT-PCR test results when testing specimens from patients with known pig exposure. Since then, CDC has monitored how the diagnostic kit has performed in detecting variant infections and has updated guidance and virus-specific assay materials (called reagents) to make sure the tests are able to detect these viruses as they have evolved.\nIn April 2013, shortly after the first influenza A(H7N9) human infections in China were reported and within days of China CDC sharing gene sequences of the H7N9 virus, U.S. CDC quickly modified and then quality-checked CDC\u2019s existing\u00a0H7 rRT-PCR test and drafted protocols and guidance for its use. On April 22, 2013, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an Emergency Use Authorization and the H7 rRT-PCR test with test components and CDC guidance were made available to public health laboratories so they would be able to test for H7N9 viruses too.\nTop of PageInternational Reagent Resource\nWhile RT-PCR is fast and accurate, it requires a steady stream of laboratory supplies called reagents (primers, probes and enzymes) to perform testing, which can become scarce or costly during outbreaks when testing demands increase.\nTo address this potential shortcoming, in 2008 CDC established the Influenza Reagent Resource (IRR) as a warehouse for CDC-developed influenza supplies that laboratories need to carry out basic research; develop diagnostics, vaccines and drugs; and conduct surveillance for emerging influenza threats. During the pandemic, the IRR proved to be a critical resource in terms of providing domestic and international laboratories with the supplies needed to test for the new 2009 H1N1 virus.\nTen years later, the IRR is firmly established as a central component of influenza research, surveillance and diagnostic testing in the United States. Further, it also has been expanded to include production and distribution of additional CDC-developed reagents for a wider range of pathogens that are within the scope of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD).Some of the newer additions include reagents for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV), meningitis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The program\u2019s broader scope is reflected in a new name, the International Reagent Resource.\nWith regard to pandemic preparedness, public health laboratories across the globe continue to use the reagents they receive from the IRR for surveillance of novel influenza viruses (such as H7N9 and H5N1) in tandem with the World Health Organization (WHO) Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS).external icon For influenza and other pathogens, CDC\u2019s subject matter experts provide technical guidance and oversight to ensure that IRR acquires, authenticates, manufactures and distributes quality-controlled reagents that support global surveillance efforts.\nTop of PageAdvances in Tests Used in Clinical Settings\n\nCompared to ten years ago, clinicians now have more tests available for detection of influenza viruses in respiratory specimens, including a wider selection of highly accurate molecular assays (some rapid, some not), and improved rapid influenza antigen detection tests (RIDTs).\nRapid and accurate diagnosis of influenza virus infection facilitates timely patient management for seasonal influenza as well as pandemic influenza. Influenza testing has been used to inform decisions on the use of antiviral drugs for treatment, to avoid misuse of antibiotics for treatment, and to reduce the need for other diagnostic tests. Influenza testing also can be helpful in informing recommendations for sick people living with others who are at high risk of developing serious influenza complications. See\u00a0Guide for considering influenza testing when influenza viruses are circulating in the community for more information.)\nThe need for better rapid influenza tests and clear rapid test guidance for clinicians became apparent during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, when false-negative rapid antigen detection test results contributed to delays and missed opportunities in treating pandemic flu virus-infected patients with antiviral drugs; and delays in implementing infection control measures for such patients. [5]\nShortly after the pandemic, CDC and partners began working to address issues with rapid antigen detection tests available at the time, reaching an important milestone in 2017 when rapid influenza antigen detection tests (RIDTs) were reclassified by FDA (described in more detail, below) and held to higher standards.\nIn June 2014, a new kind of rapid influenza test was approved by FDA (the Alere (TM) i Influenza A&B test by Alere Scarborough, Inc D/B/A Binax, Inc, now owned by Abbott and called the ID NOWTIM Influenza A&B) external iconwhich detects flu A and B viruses by detecting the PB2 flu virus gene in respiratory specimens. This approval marked the beginning of a new category of tests, referred to as rapid influenza molecular assays.\nRapid influenza molecular assays are a relatively new type of influenza diagnostic test. These tests are similar to RT-PCR (which is also a molecular process and currently the gold standard for influenza virus detection), in that both tests use nucleic acid amplification, which detects influenza viruses in a respiratory specimen by amplifying (multiplying) certain nucleic acids (building blocks of genes) in the influenza virus genome.\nSince 2014, other rapid influenza molecular assays have been approved by FDA and are available for use in clinical settings. Of those, some are approved for point-of-care or bedside use, and do not require a clinical laboratory, including Cobas\u00ae Influenza A/B and Cobas\u00ae Influenza A/B RSV Assay by Roche Molecular Diagnostics; Xpert Xpress Flu and Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV by Cepheid; Accula Flu A/Flu B assay by Mesa Biotech Inc,; and ID Now TM by Abbot.\nRapid influenza molecular assays have a strong ability to identify correctly patients with evidence of influenza virus infection (referred to as high sensitivity, greater than 90%) and a strong ability to identify correctly patients without evidence of influenza virus infection, referred to as high specificity (90-100%). These assays produce results in 15 to 30 minutes, making them a convenient option for clinical management of patients. Other rapid influenza molecular assays (such as the Cobas\u00ae Influenza A/B & RSV Assay by Roche Molecular Diagnostics) are approved that detect influenza A and B viruses and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in respiratory specimens. These tests are particularly useful in the clinical management of young children with acute respiratory illness, but can be used for persons of all ages.\nAdditionally, a number of other influenza molecular assays are FDA-approved, for use in a moderately complex or complex hospital clinical laboratory. These assays may take more than one hour to produce results. Many of these molecular assays detect influenza A and B viruses as well as other respiratory viruses such as adenovius, coronavirus, human metapneumovirus, human rhinovirus/enterovirus, parainfluenza virus, and RSV. Some also detect some respiratory bacterial infections.\nBoth rapid molecular and other molecular assays are more accurate than previously available influenza tests for use in clinical settings. These advances in molecular technology provide more-accurate influenza testing results and are likely to improve clinical management of patients with suspected influenza in ambulatory care clinics and emergency departments, and in hospitalized patients as well.\nWith regard to rapid influenza antigen detection tests (RIDTs), to address the issues identified during the pandemic, in 2011 the CDC, the Joint Commission, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), the Medical College of Wisconsin (MCW) and other public and private partners addressed key RIDT-related issues by:\n\nCreating the first method for systematically evaluating commercially available RIDTs, described in a 2012 Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) article\nEnhancing awareness among clinicians of appropriate RIDT protocols with new courses, videos and decision-making tools, and;\nWorking with FDA to reclassify RIDTs from Class I to Class II with Special Controls, thereby holding current and new RIDTs to higher performance standards.\n\nReclassification means that RIDTs are now subject to the following requirements [6]:\n\nManufacturers must test their RIDTs annually to ensure they can detect currently circulating seasonal flu viruses. RIDTs with lower sensitivity to those flu viruses will need to indicate so on their labeling.\nRIDTs must meet minimum performance criteria, such as high sensitivity and high specificity to detect flu viruses in respiratory specimens compared to RT-PCR or viral culture. This means that currently FDA-approved RIDTs will now be more accurate in detecting flu viruses in respiratory specimens than previous RIDTs.\nIn the event of a pandemic, manufacturers must test the reactivity of their RIDTs with the newly emergent flu virus as soon as virus samples become available.\nSince 2017 when reclassification of RIDTs occurred, manufacturers have made positive, steady changes to rapid influenza antigen detection tests, but more work still needs to be done.\n\nTop of PageSurveillance\nRight-sizing initiative \n\nThe massive amount of laboratory testing that occurred during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic provided an opportunity for researchers to identify the optimal levels of influenza surveillance and laboratory testing needed in the United States, including ways to improve efficiency.\nTo answer those questions, in 2010, CDC and the Association of Public Health laboratories (APHL) began developing a \u201cright-size\u201d approach to influenza virologic surveillance which was based on extensive input from public health laboratories and stakeholders. Since then, this right-size approach has helped public health laboratories to:\n\nstandardize virologic surveillance practices, determine the optimal number of specimens to test to produce statistical confidence in resulting data, and define public health surveillance priorities;\nadopt requirements, resources and statistical calculators that aid in planning and justifying budget and resource requests;\nincrease the understanding and support from political leaders and the public;\nspeak a common language between laboratories and epidemiologists; and\nassist decision makers in analyzing the impacts of budget decisions on national surveillance objectives, especially with regard to pandemic preparedness capacity.\n\nTop of PageAutomated transmission of laboratory reports\nIn addition to identifying the optimum \u201csampling\u201d strategy, major improvements in sharing this data have taken place. In March 2010, five laboratories were routinely sharing data electronically with CDC. Today, all public health laboratories at the state level and some local public health and clinical laboratories send data electronically to CDC\u2019s Influenza Division This increase has improved the timeliness and completeness of reporting, for both seasonal influenza surveillance activities and the identification of novel influenza A viruses.\nIncorporation of NCHS mortality data\nIn collaboration with the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), since the 2015-2016 flu season CDC\u2019s Influenza Division has used mortality data collected from death certificates and reported to NCHS as the principal tool to track influenza-associated mortality in the United States.\nThe shift to NCHS data marked a significant advance in the capacity to track flu mortality, owing in part to efforts made by NCHS to improve the timeliness of jurisdiction reporting and modernize the infrastructure of national vital statistics, all of which resulted in a system capable of supporting near real-time surveillance of most deaths in the United States.\nThe new system presents deaths by the date of occurrence rather than by the date on which deaths were registered. It also provides a consistent case definition and covers nearly all deaths occurring in the United States, which is an improvement over the previous (now retired) system which accounted for only 25 percent of all US deaths.\nInclusion of electronic data in ILINet\n\nCDC\u2019s U.S. Outpatient Influenza-Like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet) collects data each week from up to 3,500 outpatient health care providers across all 50 states, Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Each week, these health care providers report the total number of patients seen, and the number of patients seen with influenza-like illness (ILI), by five age groups. The process of reporting numbers of total patients and ILI patients was labor-intensive, sometimes leading to reporting delays and dips in participation. Since the pandemic, more ILINet providers have used electronic health records in determining ILI and patient visits, thereby reducing the reporting burden and providing more-comprehensive, efficient and timely surveillance. ILINet now captures more patient visits: during the 2018-19 season, more than one million patient visits were reported weekly, almost double the number of patient visits reported weekly during the 2009 pandemic.\nAntiviral resistance testing\nAnother step forward in surveillance is the number of public health laboratories in the U.S. that test for resistance to influenza antiviral medications, which increased from four laboratories before the 2009 H1N1 pandemic to 20 laboratories in 2019. This improvement was accomplished through training courses, site visits, technical and other support from CDC. In addition, four laboratories are now able to conduct advanced testing for antiviral drug resistance, using a more sensitive and complex procedure. Since 2018, CDC\u2019s influenza laboratories have been testing seasonal and animal viruses for susceptibility to the newest anti-influenza drug \u2013 baloxavir marboxil (Xofluza) and a CDC-developed assay is now being implemented at the public health laboratory designated for antiviral testing (NIRC, Albany NY). Lastly, in collaboration with a World Health Organization (WHO) expert group, reference laboratory materials for detection and reporting of influenza drug resistance have been developed and shared with laboratories around the world.\nTop of PageThe Burden of Influenza\nDuring the pandemic, influenza hospitalization rates increased, particularly among groups of people at high risk of developing serious flu complications.\nThe Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET) conducts population-based surveillance for laboratory-confirmed influenza-related hospitalizations in children and adults. It has provided critical data for:\n\ninforming policy and decision making, especially with regard to vaccine and antiviral prioritization;\nevaluating the effectiveness and safety of pandemic vaccine; and,\nidentifying groups at high risk for severe flu complications.\n\nOver the course of the pandemic, CDC refined and revised its hospitalization surveillance methods, eventually developing a way to use FluSurv-NET data to estimate the range of 2009 pandemic flu illnesses, hospitalizations and deaths (also referred to as \u2018estimates of flu burden\u2019) in the United States.\nSince the 2009 pandemic, this method of estimation has been applied at the end of each flu season as a means of illustrating the national impact of seasonal flu. In 2019, CDC also began providing on a weekly basis preliminary estimates of the burden of influenza during flu season.\nBurden of influenza averted through vaccination\n\nCDC also developed estimates of the number of flu illnesses, hospitalizations and deaths prevented by flu vaccination each flu season. These estimates are made with mathematical models that combine illness rates, vaccine coverage, and vaccine effectiveness, to estimate the amount of flu that would have occurred without flu vaccination. The amount of flu that was prevented by vaccination was the difference between what would have occurred and what was estimated to have actually occurred. CDC has continued to estimate the benefits of influenza vaccination each season. Now, CDC and its partners are better able to communicate the benefits of flu vaccination and provide clear evidence on the public health impact that vaccination can have in reducing flu illness.\nTop of PageVaccine effectiveness monitoring\nWhile FluSurv-NET provided vaccine effectiveness (VE) data during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, the US Flu VE Network has yielded in-depth data about how well flu vaccines are working each flu season since its inception in 2005.\nSeasonal VE data are instrumental in making vaccine policy decisions and improving virus selection to update the composition of seasonal vaccines. VE data are also pivotal to understanding the epidemiology and severity of pandemic and seasonal influenza and to mounting an appropriate responses.\nFollowing the pandemic, multiple improvements were made to the US Flu VE Network including expanding the number of sites, increasing enrollment, improving the timeliness of data collection and reporting, and building an infrastructure for conducting special studies to improve the benefits of vaccines. In addition, in 2016-17 CDC established the Hospitalized Adult Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Network (HAIVEN), which focuses on VE among severely ill adults, as opposed to VE among persons seen as outpatients.\nTop of PageWith regard to available data, at the time of the pandemic, VE studies had shown that influenza vaccination reduced the risk of mild or moderately severe influenza by approximately half among children and adults, but there were gaps in knowledge about how well the vaccine worked in preventing lab-confirmed influenza among pregnant women and in preventing life-threatening influenza among children and adults.\nVE data directly influence policymakers\u2019 decisions regarding influenza vaccination policy both in the United States and in other countries, so over the last 10 years CDC has created partnerships and funded research to address major VE knowledge gaps, all with an eye toward advancing vaccination efforts in the U.S. and internationally.\nPregnant Women\n\nThe first CDC-funded study to address these gaps, which was also the first to use laboratory-confirmed influenza outcomes to assess VE among pregnant women, was published in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases in January 2014. This study, which looked at Kaiser Permanente health plan members in two regions, showed that influenza vaccination reduced their risk of flu illness by half during 2010 to 2012, indicating that flu vaccine works about as well in pregnant women as in other young, healthy adults. The study showed influenza vaccine effectiveness estimates among pregnant women were similar to those found in other studies among young adults, which ranged from 44% to 51% from 2010 to 2012.\nSee\u00a0Study Finds Flu Vaccine Reduces Risk of Flu Illness in Pregnant Women by Half for more information.\nThe second CDC-funded study was published in Clinical Infectious Diseases in October 2018: it was the first study to show that vaccination protects pregnant women against flu-associated hospitalization.\nTo conduct this study, CDC partnered with a number of other public health agencies and health care systems in Australia, Canada, Israel, and the United States through the Pregnancy Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Network (PREVENT), which consists of health care systems with integrated laboratory, medical, and vaccination records. Sites retrospectively examined medical records of more than two million women who were pregnant from 2010 through 2016 to identify those who were hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed flu.\nKey findings of this study include the following:\n\nOver the course of six flu seasons, getting a flu shot reduced a pregnant woman\u2019s risk of being hospitalized from flu by an average of 40 percent.\nMore than 80 percent of pregnancies overlapped with flu season, underscoring the likelihood that pregnant women will be exposed to flu at some point during their pregnancy.\nFlu vaccine was equally protective for pregnant women with underlying medical problems such as asthma and diabetes, which also increase the risk of serious medical complications including a worsening of those chronic conditions.\nFlu vaccine was equally protective for women during all three trimesters.\n\nSee Flu Vaccine Reduces Risk of Flu Hospitalization Among Pregnant Women for more information.\nChildren and Adults:\nIn March 2014 another critical gap was filled, when the first study to estimate VE in children against flu admissions to pediatric intensive care units (PICUs) was published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases. CDC researchers found that getting a flu vaccine reduces a child\u2019s risk of flu-related intensive care hospitalization by 74%, illustrating the important protection flu vaccine can provide to children against more-serious flu outcomes.\nResearchers analyzed the medical records of 216 children age 6 months through 17 years admitted to 21 PICUs in the United States during the 2010-2011 and 2011-2012 flu seasons.\nThough flu vaccination was associated with a significant reduction in risk of PICU admission, flu vaccine coverage was relatively low among the children in this study: only 18 percent of flu cases admitted to the ICU had been fully vaccinated.\nMore than half (55 percent) of PICU cases had at least one underlying chronic medical condition that placed them at higher risk of serious flu-related complications.\nSee\u00a0New Study Shows Flu Vaccine Reduced Children\u2019s Risk of Intensive Care Unit Flu Admission by Three-Fourths for more information.\nIn August 2018, a CDC-supported study published in Vaccine was the first to provide statistically significant VE estimates for adults against hospitalization and admission to ICU.\nThe study was conducted over four flu seasons from 2012 to 2015 and found that flu vaccination prevented severe disease:\n\nFlu vaccination among adults reduced the risk of being admitted to the hospital with flu and placed in a general ward bed by 37 percent.\n\n\nFlu vaccination was even more effective in preventing the most severe forms of flu and reduced the risk of being admitted to an ICU with flu by 82 percent.\n\nBecause flu vaccine varies in how well it works and people who are vaccinated may still get sick, the study also looked at whether flu vaccination reduced the severity of illness among hospitalized people who were vaccinated compared to those who were unvaccinated and found that:\n\nAmong adults who were admitted to the hospital with flu, vaccinated adults were 59 percent less likely to have very severe illness resulting in ICU admission than those who had not been vaccinated.\nAmong adults in the ICU with flu, vaccinated patients on average spent 4 fewer days in the hospital than those who were not vaccinated previously.\n\nThe study was a collaborative project with CDC, conducted through the Southern Hemisphere Influenza and Vaccine Effectiveness Research and Surveillance project, which prospectively enrolled hospitalized adults 18 years and older from 2012 to 2015 in Auckland, New Zealand. Eligible hospitalized patients were those who had an overnight admission with acute respiratory illness. Once enrolled in the study, patients self-reported their flu vaccination status and were tested for flu infection by RT-PCR.\nSee Study Shows Flu Vaccine Reduces Risk of Severe Illness\u00a0for more information.\nTop of PageIn February 2018, the complex process of making CVVs for avian H5 and H7 influenza viruses was streamlined by the Federal Select Agent Program with its decision to remove the requirement for live bird lethality testing.\nH5 and H7 avian influenza viruses are classified as Select Agents until it is shown that the viruses are low-pathogenic (unable to cause disease and mortality in chickens in a laboratory setting).\nPreviously, live bird lethality testing was used to determine whether an avian influenza CVV was highly pathogenic or low pathogenic, and thus if it should managed as a Select Agent.\nNow, H5 and H7-derived CVVs no longer need to be tested in live birds to show low pathogenicity. Instead, other data may be submitted in lieu of bird lethality testing.\nThe Federal Select Agent Program is managed jointly by the Division of Select Agents and Toxins at the CDC, and the Agriculture Select Agent Services at the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.\nPrevention\nInfluenza Vaccines\nCDC and its partners have made significant progress in influenza surveillance; diagnostics; characterizing viruses for vaccine strain selection; and developing systems to evaluate the effectiveness of influenza vaccines over the last ten years.\nFor example, with regard to vaccine development, by using newer production technologies CDC can now identify and provide candidate vaccine viruses for novel influenza threats to manufacturers within a matter of weeks.\nThis and other improvements have helped to better protect the public from seasonal and pandemic influenza threats through vaccination. However, to more fully protect Americans from seasonal and pandemic flu, more effective vaccines are needed and more people still need to receive annual flu vaccines.\nIn line with that public health mission, more doses of seasonal vaccines and different vaccine products are available than ever before. In addition to trivalent inactivated vaccine and live attenuated influenza vaccine, the following vaccines have been approved by the FDA and are now available:\n\na\u00a0high dose vaccine that is designed specifically for\u00a0people 65 and older to help create a stronger antibody response;\na\u00a0trivalent flu vaccine made with adjuvant (an ingredient added to vaccine that helps create a stronger immune response), which was approved for people 65 years of age and older;\nthe first U.S.-approved cell-based flu vaccine, which can potentially be made more quickly than traditional egg-based vaccines and does not require a large supply of eggs to produce;\nquadrivalent (four component) flu vaccines that protect against both lineages of influenza B viruses thus offering expanded protection against circulating influenza viruses; and,\nrecombinant influenza vaccines, which do not require an egg-grown vaccine virus or eggs to produce, and which may be manufactured more quickly than egg-based vaccines.\n\nCDC is currently exploring new ways to further improve influenza vaccine through the influenza vaccine improvement initiative (iVii). The initiative includes two primary goals.\nGoal 1: Build the evidence base for developing more-effective influenza vaccines, and increase the impact of vaccines that are currently available.\nThis goal points to the need for deeper data, so during the 2018-19 season, CDC increased the number and scope of VE Network participants by over 1,500 children and adults, bringing the total number of participants enrolled to more than 10,500.\nCDC also is increasing the diversity of people who can be enrolled in studies and has expanded VE monitoring through innovative use of health care and other data sources outside of the US Flu VE Network. The laboratory process of evaluating vaccine response through the use of enhanced serologic and cellular testing has also been improved.\nGoal 2: Increase the capacity of CDC laboratories to select, develop, evaluate and perform virus characterization to provide candidate vaccine viruses.\nTo accomplish this, CDC is employing state-of-the-art technologies to increase the volume of laboratory testing being done. CDC also is working on developing new assays for manufacturers and regulatory laboratories, and planning evaluation projects that support vaccine improvement.\nCDC also is focusing on expanding and improving global virus detection, and improving vaccine effectiveness monitoring. This is being done through the expansion of Next Generation Sequencing and fully transitioning to the Sequence-First initiative described earlier. In the process, CDC has also worked with partners to automate the pipeline used to produce, store and share the enormous volume of NGS data.\nCDC also is piloting an advanced laboratory strategy to identify viruses, using antigenic data that are likely to predominate in the human population in future influenza seasons.\nCDC meets regularly with vaccine manufacturers and other WHO Collaborating Centers and Essential Regulatory Laboratories including FDA\u2019s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research to share information on a number of vaccine-related topics.\nTopics include the availability of candidate vaccine viruses for use in the development and production of seasonal influenza vaccines, the availability of protocols and reagents needed for the development, standardization, and regulation of influenza vaccines, and to discuss potential issues related to the timely production of seasonal influenza vaccines. The group meets from the time the vaccine composition is announced until vaccines are released for distribution to health care providers, for both the northern and southern hemisphere influenza seasons.\nSeparately, frequent Flu Risk Management Meetings serve as a venue to discuss issues relating to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) response to seasonal and pandemic influenza. Subjects for discussion include but are not limited to seasonal surveillance updates, effectiveness of influenza vaccines, vaccine and antiviral stockpiles, emerging influenza virus surveillance, clinical trial response to influenza outbreaks of novel influenza viruses, and pandemic preparedness.\nTop of PageWhen a pandemic influenza A virus emerges \u2013 like H1N1 in 2009 \u2013 well-matched vaccines may not be available for 6 months or longer, and antiviral medications may be reserved for treatment and be in short supply because of high demand.\nThe goals of community mitigation measures are to delay the spread of the disease and reduce the impact of an influenza pandemic in U.S. communities.\nCommunity mitigation measures are often referred to as Non Pharmaceutical Interventions (or NPIs), and include actions other than use of vaccines and medications that people and communities can take to help slow the spread of a pandemic influenza virus.\nCommunity Mitigation Measures\nCommunity Mitigation Guidelines to Prevent Pandemic Influenza \u2013 United States, 2017 \nBased on lessons learned from the 2009 H1N1 pandemic response and an expanded contemporary NPI evidence base, CDC published updated pre-pandemic planning guidelines \u2013 Community Mitigation Guidelines to Prevent Pandemic Influenza \u2013 United States, 2017 \u2013 in MMWR Recommendations and Reports on April 21, 2017. The guidelines offer free CE credits for healthcare and public health practitioners, and are available at https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/66/rr/pdfs/rr6601.pdfpdf icon.\nThe 2017 guidelines summarize key lessons learned from the 2009 H1N1 pandemic response; encourage state and local public health officials to plan and prepare for implementing NPIs early in an influenza pandemic in community settings; describe new or updated pandemic planning and assessment tools; and provide the latest scientific findings to support updated recommendations on the use of NPIs to help slow the spread and decrease the impact of an influenza pandemic. The 2009 H1N1 pandemic response highlighted that pre-pandemic planning and preparedness \u2013 from local to federal levels \u2013 must be broad, flexible, and multi-sectoral, and emphasized the critical value of public engagement and community preparedness \u2013 including families, schools, and businesses \u2013 for successful NPI implementation during a pandemic. Research conducted during and in the wake of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic documented that public acceptance of NPIs in the United States is generally high, even for disruptive measures like school closures. These findings underscore the importance of pandemic preparedness at all levels of society to ensure timely implementation of community mitigation measures from the onset of a future pandemic, when these measures may be the only tool available in many jurisdictions.\nTo help implement the 2017 guidelines and to assist states and localities with pre-pandemic planning and decision-making in their communities, CDC also published online six plain-language, pre-pandemic NPI planning guides for various audiences and community settings: households, educational settings, workplace settings, community- and faith-based organizations serving vulnerable populations, event planners of large/mass gatherings, and health communicators in community preparedness. The six guides are available.\nCDC continues to conduct and support research to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of NPI implementation in various community settings. Select NPI research references, as well as additional NPI communication, education, and training materials, are available at CDC\u2019s dedicated NPI website.\nTop of PageTreatment\n\nThe number of available, approved and recommended treatment options has increased in the last ten years.\nDuring the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, the influenza antiviral medication oseltamivir (oral oseltamivir, available under the trade name Tamiflu\u00ae) was used extensively for treatment, while zanamivir (inhaled, trade name Relenza\u00ae) was used less.\nOral oseltamivir\u2019s widespread use was due to it being approved, recommended and utilized for treatment of patients hospitalized with severe influenza. It also was recommended for use in hospitalized patients with non-severe influenza, although no antiviral medications were approved by FDA for use in that group.\nOutpatients could be prescribed either oral oseltamivir or inhaled zanamivir, which were both approved for early treatment of uncomplicated influenza by FDA.\nOf the two medications, CDC was more concerned with the possibility of resistance emerging against oseltamivir, which did happen, but not often. The oseltamivir-resistant viruses that did emerge were not transmitted easily from person to person, and zanamivir was used effectively to treat them.\nBeginning in April 2009 and continuing for a few years after the pandemic, the FDA\u2019s Emergency Investigational New Drug (EIND) program provided an application process which authorized investigational use of IV zanamivir for patients with severe and life-threatening influenza.\nLater, on October 23rd, 2009, FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for IV Peramivir. At the time, IV Peramivir was an investigational intravenous antiviral drug used rarely to treat people who had been hospitalized with severe influenza. The drug was held in the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) and distributed by CDC under the EUA. Licensed clinicians were able to request this product through the CDC website electronic request system, and product was delivered directly to hospital facilities until June 2010 when the EUA was terminated.\nTop of PageFollowing the pandemic, in December 2014, IV Peramivir was approved by FDA for early treatment of uncomplicated influenza in outpatients, which also opened up some off-label use in treating influenza in hospitalized patients. Previously, with the exception of the IV Peramivir EUA during the pandemic, oseltamivir and zanamivir were the only recommended antiviral medications for treatment of influenza. (The other approved antiviral drugs \u2013 amantadine and rimantadine \u2013 were not and are still not recommended due to high levels of resistance detected in circulating influenza viruses).\nRoughly three years later, in September 2017, FDA approved the first generic version of oseltamivir.\nOseltamivir, zanamivir and IV peramivir are all neuraminidase-inhibitor influenza antiviral medications, so named because each works by targeting the neuraminidase surface protein of the influenza virus to stop the virus from being released from infected cells and spreading to healthy cells.\nIn December 2018, a new influenza antiviral medication called oral baloxavir marboxil (trade name Xofluza\u00ae) was approved by FDA and is recommended for treatment of influenza. Baloxavir works differently, primarily by preventing an influenza virus from multiplying when it is inside a cell. Because baloxavir works differently, it is in a new class of antiviral medications called cap-dependent endonuclease inhibitors. Like the neuraminidase-inhibitor medications, baloxavir has activity against both influenza A and B viruses. Baloxavir is approved for early treatment of uncomplicated influenza in outpatients aged 12 years and older.\nWith more antiviral medications approved, recommended and available, treatment options have improved for both hospitalized patients with severe influenza and outpatients seeking treatment early for uncomplicated influenza. There remains a gap, however, in approved antiviral treatment options for hospitalized patients with non-severe influenza, although CDC and IDSA (Infectious Diseases Society of America) continue to recommend that those patients be treated with neuraminidase-inhibitor antiviral medications.\nTop of PageDecision-making tools\nRisk assessment (IRAT)\nThe 2009 H1N1 pandemic highlighted the public health value of developing an objective, scientifically based tool for assessing the potential pandemic risk posed to humans by influenza A viruses circulating in animals. To fill that need, CDC developed an evaluation tool now called the Influenza Risk Assessment Tool (IRAT) with help from global animal and human health influenza experts. IRAT launched in 2011 and since then CDC has used it to evaluate the potential risk posed by viruses that are not currently circulating in people. The IRAT relies on input from subject matter experts representing a variety of expertise in the study of influenza viruses. It uses 10 evaluation criteria grouped into major categories including properties of the virus, attributes of the human population, and epidemiology and ecology of the virus, to generate scores that indicate the potential risk of the virus to emerge as a pandemic virus, and the potential impact if it does.\nThe IRAT is not a prediction tool. Rather, the IRAT provides structure to prioritize and maximize investments in pandemic preparedness; identify key gaps in information; document transparently the data and scientific process used to inform management decisions associated with pandemic preparedness; provide a flexible means to easily and regularly update the risk assessment of novel flu viruses as new information becomes available; communicate effectively to the general public, policymakers, public health laboratories and other stakeholders; and provide a means to weigh the 10 evaluation criteria differently depending on whether the intent is to measure the ability of a virus to \u201cemerge\u201d as a pandemic-capable virus, or \u201cimpact\u201d the human population after emerging.\nSince its inception eight years ago, the IRAT has been used by CDC to evaluate and inform pandemic preparedness decisions for 16 viruses, the results of which are listed at Summary of Influenza Risk Assessment Tool (IRAT) Results.\nTop of PageForecasting\nUnlike traditional surveillance systems that lag behind the real-time situation, flu forecasting offers the possibility to look into the future and forecast when and where flu increases will occur, how large the impact of flu will be, and when flu will peak. Forecasts can inform messaging to health care providers regarding influenza vaccination and antiviral treatment for patients, help to prepare for an influx of illnesses and hospitalizations, and be used to guide community mitigation strategies, such as school closures.\nTo support the development of the science of flu forecasting and its application for public health, CDC, through the Epidemic Prediction Initiative (EPI), organized the first FluSight challenge to forecast the timing, intensity, and short-term activity of the influenza season during the 2013-14 season. Each influenza season since then, Influenza Division researchers have worked with CDC\u2019s EPI and other external researchers to improve flu forecasting. CDC provides forecasting teams data, relevant public health forecasting targets, and forecast accuracy metrics evaluated against actual flu activity while each team submits their forecasts based on a variety of methods and data sources each week. During the 2018\u201319 season, forecasting teams provided over 30 national-level forecasts each week.\nThese challenges have provided the scientific and public health community with experience in real-time forecasting, the ability to evaluate forecast accuracy, and familiarity in communicating and applying these forecasts in real-world settings. These experiences are critical to developing a network of forecasters capable of providing results that public health officials can use, both in seasons and during an influenza pandemic.\nForecasts are currently used to inform CDC\u2019s activity summaries provided to public health officials and CDC leadership, and to inform messages to the general public regarding the timing of the influenza season and steps the public can take to protect their health.\nTop of PageInternational work\n\nCDC has strong global ties with other WHO Collaborating Centers for Influenza, National Influenza Centers and ministries of health around the world. These collaborators provided critical data throughout the influenza pandemic on how, when and where the pandemic virus might be changing and if the monovalent pandemic vaccine would continue to be effective in preventing infection.\nCDC\u2019s Influenza Division formed an influenza international capacity-building initiative in 2004, which provided a five-year period of financial support for nine countries to improve laboratory diagnostics and sentinel surveillance for influenza-like illness and severe acute respiratory infection. In 2009, this number increased to 37 countries receiving support under 39 cooperative agreements.\nThus, the 2009 H1N1 pandemic occurred at a time when many of the 37 countries benefited from the newly established influenza surveillance and laboratory capacities. The pandemic provided the ultimate test to determine whether their laboratory diagnostics and surveillance systems were indeed strong enough to manage the massive surges in flu activity that would come their way.\nShortly after the pandemic, eight of the 37 countries transitioned to the program\u2019s second five-year period, called the sustainability period. During this period, financial support was reduced as the programs focused on sustaining the gains made in laboratory diagnostics and surveillance. The countries focused on standardizing foundational aspects of influenza surveillance including regular influenza activity reporting and sending viruses to CDC and other WHO Collaborating Centers, all with an eye toward ensuring preparedness for the next pandemic.\nNow, following 10 years of the pandemic\u2019s race around the globe, which caused hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide, many countries have graduated from the sustainability period to maintenance and some are now developing in-country seasonal influenza vaccination programs based on their influenza surveillance data.\nThe 2009 H1N1 pandemic tested U.S. laboratory and surveillance systems and highlighted many successes along the way, shining a light on one of the biggest takeaways of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic: develop seasonal influenza epidemiology and laboratory capacity that\u2019s flexible enough to handle the next pandemic.\nTop of Page1. http://www.cdc.gov/flu/spotlights/pandemic-global-estimates.htm\n2.

This risk is due in part to changes in immune defenses with increasing age. While flu seasons vary in severity, during most seasons, people 65 years and older bear the greatest burden of severe flu disease. In recent years, for example, it\u2019s estimated\u00a0that between 70 percent and 85 percent of seasonal flu-related deaths have occurred in people 65 years and older, and between 50 percent and 70 percent of seasonal flu-related hospitalizations have occurred among people in this age group.\nA Flu Vaccine is the Best Protection Against Flu\nFlu Vaccine Reduces Risk of Flu Illness and Serious OutcomesFlu vaccination has many benefits. It has been shown to reduce flu illnesses and also to reduce the risk of more serious flu outcomes that can result in hospitalization or even death in older people. Flu vaccination has been shown in several studies to reduce severity of illness in people who get vaccinated but still get sick.\nMore\nThe best way to protect against flu and its potentially serious complications is with a flu vaccine.\u00a0CDC recommends that almost everyone 6 months of age and older get a seasonal flu vaccine each year by the end of October. However, as long as flu viruses are circulating, vaccination should continue throughout flu season, even into January or later.\nFlu vaccination is especially important for people 65 years and older because they are at high risk of developing serious complications from flu. Flu vaccines are updated each season as needed to keep up with changing viruses. Also, immunity wanes over a year so annual vaccination is needed to ensure the best possible protection against flu. A flu vaccine protects against the flu viruses that research indicates will be most common during the upcoming season. (See Vaccine Virus Selection\u00a0for this season\u2019s exact vaccine composition.) Flu vaccines for 2020-2021 have been updated from last season\u2019s vaccine to better match circulating viruses. Immunity from vaccination fully sets in after about two weeks.\nBecause of age-related changes in their immune systems, people 65 years and older may not respond as well to vaccination as younger people. Although immune responses may be lower in older people, studiesexternal icon\u00a0have consistently found that flu vaccine has been effective in reducing the risk of medical visits and hospitalizations associated with flu.\nTypes of Flu Shots for People 65 and Older\nPeople 65 years and older should get a flu shot, not a nasal spray vaccine. They can get any flu vaccine approved for use in their age group with no preference for any one vaccine over another. There are regular flu shots that are approved for use in people 65 years and older and there also are two vaccines designed specifically for this group:\nHigh Dose Flu Vaccine\nThe high dose vaccine (brand name Fluzone High-Dose) contains four times the amount of antigen (the inactivated virus that promotes a protective immune response) as a regular flu shot. It is associated with a stronger immune response following vaccination (higher antibody production). Results from a clinical trial of more than 30,000 participants showed that adults 65 years and older who received the high dose vaccine had 24% fewer influenza illnesses as compared to those who received the standard dose flu vaccine. The high dose vaccine has been approved for use in the United States since 2009. Learn more about high dose flu vaccine here.\nAdjuvanted Flu Vaccine\nThe adjuvanted flu vaccine (brand name Fluad) is made with MF59 adjuvant, an additive that can create a stronger immune response to vaccination. In a recent review of multiple vaccine trials, older adults who received a MF59-adjuvated vaccine had a significantly higher immune response than those who received a standard flu vaccine, The adjuvanted\u00a0vaccine was available for the first time in the United States during the 2016-2017 flu season. Learn more about adjuvanted flu vaccine here.\nHigh Dose and Adjuvanted Flu Vaccine Side Effects\nThe high dose and adjuvanted flu vaccines may result in more of the temporary, mild side effects that can occur with standard-dose seasonal shots. Side effects can include pain, redness or swelling at the injection site, headache, muscle ache and malaise, and typically resolve with 1 to 3 days.\nMore information about different types of flu vaccines can be found here.\nGet pneumococcal vaccines\n\nPeople who are 65 years and older also should be up to date with pneumococcal vaccination\u00a0to protect against pneumococcal disease, such as pneumonia, meningitis, and bloodstream infections. Talk to your health care provider to find out which pneumococcal vaccines are recommended for you.\nPneumococcal pneumonia is an example of a serious flu-related complication\u00a0that can cause death. You can get the pneumococcal vaccine your provider recommends when you get a flu vaccine.\n\n\nOther Preventive Actions\nIn addition to getting a flu shot, people 65 years and older should take the same everyday preventive actions\u00a0CDC recommends for everyone,\u00a0including avoiding people who are sick, covering coughs, and washing hands often.\n\n\n\nalert icon \n\n\nIn the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, local governments or public health departments may recommend additional precautions be taken in your community. Follow those instructions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSymptoms and Treatment\nBecause you are at high risk of developing serious flu complications, if you get sick with flu symptoms, call your health care provider right away. There are antiviral drugs\u00a0that can treat flu illness and prevent serious flu complications. CDC recommends prompt treatment for people who have influenza infection or suspected influenza infection and who are at high risk for serious flu complications, including people 65 years and older.\nSymptoms:\nFlu symptoms include fever, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, body aches, headache, chills and fatigue. Some people may also have vomiting and diarrhea. People may be infected with flu and have respiratory symptoms without a fever.\nTreatment:\n\nTreatment should begin as soon as possible because antiviral drugs work best when started early (within 48 hours after symptoms start).\nFor you to get an antiviral drug, a health care provider needs to write a prescription. These medicines fight against flu by keeping flu viruses from making more viruses in your body.\nAntiviral drugs can make your flu illness milder and make you feel better faster. They may also prevent serious health problems that can result from flu illness.\nThere are four FDA-approved influenza antiviral drugs\u00a0recommended by CDC this season that can be used to treat the flu.\n\nWhat are the emergency warning signs of flu?People experiencing these warning signs should obtain medical care right away.\n\nIn children\n\nFast breathing or trouble breathing\nBluish lips or face\nRibs pulling in with each breath\nChest pain\nSevere muscle pain (child refuses to walk)\nDehydration (no urine for 8 hours, dry mouth, no tears when crying)\nNot alert or interacting when awake\nSeizures\nFever above 104\u00b0F\nIn children less than 12 weeks, any fever\nFever or cough that improve but then return or worsen\nWorsening of chronic medical conditions\n\n\n\nIn adults\n\nDifficulty breathing or shortness of breath\nPersistent pain or pressure in the chest or abdomen\nPersistent dizziness, confusion, inability to arouse\nSeizures\nNot urinating\nSevere muscle pain\nSevere weakness or unsteadiness\nFever or cough that improve but then return or worsen\nWorsening of chronic medical conditions\n\n\n\n\nThese lists are not all inclusive.

While CDC conducts annual education and awareness campaigns with the goal of increasing flu vaccination, this season, extra work has been done in this area, including the launch of a new campaign called: No One Has Time for Flu.\nThe campaign is the result of a collaborationpdf iconexternal icon between The Ad Council, the American Medical Association (AMA), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the CDC Foundation, which along with AMA provided campaign funding. The campaign aims to increase vaccine uptake overall, but puts a particular emphasis on reaching African American and Hispanic/LatinX communities, populations that can be \u00a0disproportionately affected by flu illness and serious flu complications, but are less likely to be vaccinated.\nCampaign public service announcements (PSAs) presented by the Ad Council run on space donated by TV stations, media outlets, and social media platforms. Many campaign assets, including television public service announcements, are available for viewing and sharing at http://getmyflushot.adcouncilkit.org/external icon.\nIn preparation for the campaign, the Ad Council arranged for quantitative research surveys to be fielded, to help understand behaviors and attitudes towards flu vaccines in 2020 among African American and Hispanic uncommitted consumers, defined as people who had not yet decided to get vaccinated this season.\n\nSurvey findings showed that 52% of Hispanic adults and 43% of African American adults said they are likely to get a flu shot in 2020. This compares to 63% among White adults.\nNearly 40% of both African American and Hispanic respondents remain uncommitted, which compares to just 24% of whites. Research suggests inertia is a big factor in why African Americans and Hispanics do not get a flu vaccine. The top reason given for not getting vaccinated was \u201cI never get the flu shot/not something I do.\u201d\nThe Ad Council partnered with fluent360, a creative agency based in Chicago, to develop the creative concept and materials for the No One Has Time for Flu campaign. The PSAs highlight the different circumstances many people are experiencing as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the fact that, now, more than ever, no one has time to be sick with flu.

Participants, including director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health Dr. Anthony Fauci, urged the public and health care professionals to follow the CDC recommendation that everyone 6 months and older get vaccinated against flu annually\nRoll Your #SleeveUp to Fight Flu!\nEncourage your followers on social media to roll up their sleeves for an annual flu vaccine by featuring photos of yourself and others in your community getting a flu vaccine or showing off a bandage after getting a flu vaccine.\n#SleeveUp\nCDC also released multiple reports on the 2019-2020 flu season today, including influenza vaccination coverage estimates among the U.S. public, health care providers and pregnant women. The agency also released updated preliminary estimates on the burden of flu last season, and for the first time, estimates for the burden of flu averted by vaccination last season.\nDuring 2019-2020, CDC estimates there were 38 million flu illnesses, 18 million flu-associated medical visits, 400,000 flu hospitalizations and 22,000 flu-associated deaths. These numbers are lower than the in-season burden estimates\u00a0provided last season, because they were calculated using more recently available data on flu testing practices in patients hospitalized with flu, which is a key input in the model CDC uses to generate these estimates. Influenza testing has increased in recent years, which can cause preliminary burden estimates to change. An example is the preliminary burden estimates made for the 2017-2018 season, when an initial estimate of 79,000 deaths, was later updated to 61,000. The CDC website has more information on how CDC estimates flu burden.\nCDC also provided new estimates on the burden of flu averted by vaccination last season. CDC estimates that flu vaccination prevented 7.5 million flu illnesses, 3.7 million flu medical visits, 105,000 flu hospitalizations and 6,300 flu deaths. These estimates are based on vaccine effectiveness estimates from 2019-2020, as well as data on vaccine coverage during last flu season which were also released by CDC today.\nCDC\u2019s influenza vaccination coverage reports show that overall flu vaccination coverage (among people 6 months and older) during 2019-2020 increased from the previous season to nearly 52%. This is the highest flu vaccine coverage for this age group recorded since CDC recommended universal influenza vaccination of all persons 6 months and older in 2010. However, this figure also means that nearly half of U.S. residents did not get vaccinated. While flu vaccination increased overall for both children and adults, coverage did not increase among certain racial and ethnic groups. Black children have lower flu vaccination coverage than children of all other racial/ethnic groups. Hispanic adults and black adults continue to have lower flu vaccination coverage than white adults. Additionally, only 44% of people with chronic conditions were vaccinated against flu last season. And while flu vaccination coverage among pregnant women increased from 54% to 61% that still leaves a significant number of pregnant women and their babies unprotected from flu. Pregnant women and people with certain chronic conditions are among those at higher risk for flu complications, so it is especially important for them to be vaccinated against flu annually. Lastly, CDC\u2019s flu vaccination coverage estimates for health care workers show that 81% were vaccinated against flu last season. Coverage was highest among physicians (98%) and lowest among aides and assistants (72%).\nCDC has emphasized the added importance of getting a flu vaccine during the 2020-2021 flu season because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. While it is unclear how the pandemic will affect the flu season, CDC is preparing for COVID-19 and seasonal flu to spread at the same time. Co-circulation could place a tremendous burden on our health care system and result in many illnesses, hospitalizations and deaths. Getting a flu vaccine is something easy people can do to protect themselves and their loved ones and to help reduce the spread of flu this fall and winter. Flu vaccine will not protect against COVID-19. But vaccination has many other benefits and is part of a comprehensive public health strategy to reduce the burden of flu, which can flatten the curve of respiratory illnesses overall, help protect essential workers from flu, and preserve medical resources for care of patients with COVID-19. October is a good time to get vaccinated, but as long as flu viruses are circulating, vaccination can continue\u2014even in January or later. The more people who are vaccinated against flu; the more people are protected from flu.\nNow More Than Ever\nCDC recommends everyone 6 months and older be vaccinated against flu. It protects the person getting vaccinated and the people around them. Flu vaccines have been shown to prevent flu illness and reduce the risk of hospitalizations and deaths. Flu vaccination is proven to help protect pregnant women and people with chronic health conditions while reducing the burden of flu on our communities and health care system. This year, especially, it will be most important to protect those at higher risk for flu complications. Many of these people are also at high risk for COVID-19 illness or serious outcomes. It is also important for caregivers and essential workers to protect themselves and those around them from flu by getting a flu vaccine.\nVaccine and Administration\nManufacturers estimate between 194 and 198 million doses of flu vaccine will be available this season. Approximately 99% of the flu vaccines will be quadrivalent. COVID-19 activity may affect when, where and how flu vaccines will be given. CDC has provided interim guidance for vaccination to help immunization providers ensure safe administration of vaccines during the pandemic. So far, nearly 90 million doses of flu vaccine have been distributed in the United States.\nVaccination Coverage\n\nFlu Vaccination Coverage, United States, 2019-20 Influenza Season\nFlu Vaccination Coverage Among Pregnant Women \u2013 United States, 2019-20 Flu Season\nInfluenza Vaccination Coverage Among Health Care Personnel \u2014 United States, 2020\u201321 Influenza Season\n\n2019-2020 Influenza Season Estimates\n\nEstimated Influenza Illnesses, Medical visits, Hospitalizations, and Deaths in the United States \u2014 2019\u20132020 influenza season\u200b\u200b\nEstimated Influenza Illnesses, Medical visits, and Hospitalizations Averted by Vaccination in the United States \u2014 2019\u20132020 Influenza Season\u200b\n\n2020- 2021 Flu Season Updates\n\n2020 NFID Influenza/Pneumococcal News Conferenceexternal icon\n2020-2021 Flu Season Information\nCDC\u2019s 2020-2021 Seasonal Flu Vaccination Campaign Digital Toolkit\n\nHealth Care Provider Resources\n\nPrevention and Control of Seasonal Influenza with Vaccines: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices \u2014 United States, 2020\u201321 Influenza Season\nCDC Updates for Health Care Providers about the 2020-2021 Flu Season\nResources to help health care professionals make a strong flu vaccine recommendation\n\n\nFull Infographicimage icon \u200b\nEstimated Influenza Illnesses, Medical visits, and Hospitalizations Averted by Vaccination in the United States \u2014 2019\u20132020 Influenza Season\u200b", "reports": [{"diseases": ["COVID-19"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "2010-03-23 00:00:00", "locations": [6255150]}]}{"url": "https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/2019-2020.html", "date_of_publication": "", "headline": "Estimated Influenza Illnesses, Medical visits, Hospitalizations, and Deaths in the United States \u2014 2019\u20132020 Influenza Seaso", "main_text": "Estimated Influenza Illnesses, Medical visits, Hospitalizations, and Deaths in the United States \u2014 2019\u20132020 Influenza Season   \n\n\nOn This Page\n\nIntroduction 2019\u20132020 Burden EstimatesConclusionBurden Estimates Limitations Flu Burden InfographicReferences \n\nIntroduction\nThis web page provides estimates on the burden of influenza (flu) in the United States for the 2019\u20132020 flu season. For the past several years, CDC has used a mathematical model to estimate the numbers of influenza illnesses, medical visits, hospitalizations, and deaths (1-4). The methods used to calculate the estimates have been described previously (1-2). CDC uses the estimates of the burden of flu in the population to inform policy and communications related to influenza prevention and control.\nBenefits of Flu Vaccination for the 2019-2020 SeasonCDC estimates the influenza illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths prevented by seasonal influenza vaccination.\nMore2019\u20132020 Burden Estimates\nInfluenza activity in the United States during the 2019\u20132020 season began to increase in November and was consistently high through January and February.\u00a0 The season was characterized by two consecutive waves of activity, beginning with influenza B viruses and followed by A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses. Overall, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were the most commonly reported influenza viruses this season. Activity began to decline in March, perhaps associated with community prevention measures for COVID-19 (5-6). The 2019-20 season is described as having moderate severity; however, the effect of influenza differed by age group and the severity of the season in some age groups was higher. Hospitalization rates among children 0-4 years old and adults 18-49 years old were higher than observed during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic (6).\nCDC estimates that the burden of illness during the 2019\u20132020 season was moderate with an estimated 38 million people sick with flu, 18 million visits to a health care provider for flu, 400,000 hospitalizations for flu, and 22,000 flu deaths \u00a0(Table 1). The number of cases of influenza-associated illness, medically attended illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths were lower than some more recent seasons and similar to other seasons where influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses dominated (7, 8).\nThe 2019\u20132020 influenza season was atypical in that it was severe for children aged 0-4 years and adults 18-49 years where rates of infections, medically attended illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths were higher than those observed during the 2017-2018 season, a recent season with high severity (7). The burden of influenza and the rates of influenza-associated hospitalization are usually higher for the very young and the very old, and while this was observed during the 2019\u20132020 season, rates of hospitalization in adults aged 18-49 years were the highest seasonal rates seen since the 2017-2018 season (Table 2). These rates mean that an estimated 15 million cases of influenza in younger adults (aged 18-49 years), which is the highest number of infections for this age group since CDC began reporting influenza burden estimates in the 2010-11 season.\nCDC\u2019s estimates of hospitalizations and mortality associated with the 2019\u20132020 influenza season show the effects that influenza virus infections can have on society. More than 52,000 hospitalizations occurred in children aged < 18 years and 86,000 hospitalizations among adults aged 18-49 years. Forty-three percent of hospitalizations occurred in older adults aged \u226565 years. Older adults also accounted for 62% of deaths, which is lower than recent previous seasons.\u00a0 These findings continue to highlight that older adults are particularly vulnerable to severe disease with influenza virus infection. An estimated 7,800 deaths (36% of all deaths) occurred among working age adults (aged 18\u201364 years), an age group for which influenza vaccine coverage is often low (9). This also underscores that influenza viruses can affect individuals of any age and prevention measures such as vaccination are important to reducing the impact of the seasonal epidemics on the population and healthcare system.\nDeaths in children with laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infection have been a reportable disease in the United States since 2004; 188 deaths were reported for the 2019-20 season as of September 19, 2020. However, influenza-associated pediatric deaths are likely under-reported, as not all children whose death was related to an influenza virus infection may have been tested for flu (10,11). Therefore, we used a mathematical model to estimate the total number of pediatric deaths based on hospitalization rates and the frequency of death in and out of the hospital using death certificates. We estimate that at least 434 deaths associated with influenza occurred during the 2019-2020 season among children aged <18 years.\nConclusion\nDuring the 2019-2020 influenza season, CDC estimates that influenza was associated with 38 million illnesses, 18 million medical visits, 405,000 hospitalizations, and 22,000 deaths. The influenza burden was higher in young children (0-4 years) and adults (18-49 years) compared with a recent season with the 2017-2018 season, a recent season with high severity, and provides evidence to support how severe seasonal influenza can be at any age.\nBurden Estimates Limitations\nThese estimates are subject to several limitations.\nFirst, rates of influenza-associated hospitalizations are based on data reported to the Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv\u2013NET) through September 2, 2020. Final case counts may differ slightly as further data cleaning from the 2019-2020 season are conducted by FluSurv\u2013NET sites. The most updated crude rates of hospitalization for FluSurv-NET sites are available on FluView Interactive (6).\nSecond, national rates of influenza-associated hospitalizations and in-hospital death were adjusted for the frequency of influenza testing and the sensitivity of influenza diagnostic assays, using a multiplier approach (3). However, data on testing practices during the 2019\u20132020 season were not available at the time of estimation. We adjusted rates using the lowest multiplier from any season between 2010\u20132011 and 2017\u20132018. Burden estimates from the 2019\u20132020 season will be updated at a later date when data on contemporary testing practices become available.\nThird, estimates of influenza-associated illness are made by multiplying the number of hospitalizations by the ratio of illnesses to hospitalizations; estimates of medical visits are made by a similar process.\u00a0 These multipliers are based on data from a prior season, which may not be accurate if patterns of care-seeking have changed.\nFourth, our estimate of influenza-associated deaths relies on information about location of death from death certificates to calculate ratios of deaths occurring in the hospital to deaths occurring outside of the hospital by categories of causes of death. \u00a0However, death certificate data during the 2019\u20132020 season were not available at the time of estimation. We used death certification data from all influenza seasons from 2010\u20132011 through 2017\u20132018 where these data were available from the National Center for Health Statistics. To calculate these ratios, first we calculate the frequency of flu-related deaths reported from our FluSurv-NET surveillance system that have cause of death identified as pneumonia or influenza (P&I), other respiratory or cardiovascular (other R&C), or other non-respiratory, non-cardiovascular (non-R&C).\u00a0 Next, to account for deaths occurring outside of a hospital, we use information from national death certificates to calculate the proportion of deaths from these causes that occur in and out of the hospital. Data to generate these frequencies were not available from the 2019\u20132020 season at the time of estimation, so we used the average frequencies of location of death for each of the cause categories from previous seasons, 2010\u20132011 through 2017\u20132018.\nFifth, estimates of burden were derived from rates of influenza-associated hospitalization, which is a different approach than the statistical models used in older published reports. This makes it difficult to directly compare our estimates for seasons since 2009 to those older reports, though the estimates from our current method are largely consistent with estimates produced with statistical models for similar years (12\u201313). \u00a0However, it is useful to keep in mind that direct comparisons to influenza disease burden decades ago are complicated by large differences in the age of the US population and the increasing number of adults aged \u226565 years.\nTop of PageWhy are these estimates lower than the preliminary in-season burden estimates last updated in April 2020?\nThese estimates are an update to the preliminary in-season 2019-20 burden estimates published April 2020 and are based on more recently available information. The current 2019-20 burden estimates are lower than those provided in April 2020 because of expected changes in available data on flu testing practices in patients hospitalized with flu, as well as unexpected data delays due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in Spring 2020.\nThere is a trade-off between timeliness and accuracy of burden of disease estimates. To provide timely burden estimates to the public, clinicians, and public health decision-makers, CDC uses preliminary data that may lead to over- or under-estimates of the true burden. However, each season\u2019s estimates will be finalized when data on testing practices and deaths for that season are available.\nFor these estimates, we included additional information to better capture flu testing practices at sites in the hospital-based surveillance system, FluSurv-NET, that collects data on patients hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed flu. Flu testing is done at the request of individual clinicians, but not everyone is tested, and flu tests are not perfectly accurate. Thus, reports of laboratory-confirmed flu-related hospitalizations to FluSurv-NET are underestimates of the true number of hospitalizations. To adjust for this, CDC collects data annually from participating FluSurv-NET sites on the amount of flu testing and the type of tests used at the site. This information is used to correct for the underestimates of flu-related hospitalizations. These testing data are often not available for up to 2 years after the end of a flu season, and thus the burden estimates are revised when additional testing data become available.\nThe preliminary in-season 2019-20 burden estimates were made using the highest flu testing rate for each age-group from the 2010-2011 through the 2016-2017 seasons. The current estimates were made using the highest testing rate for each age-group from the 2010-2011 through the 2017-2018 seasons. The additional data from the 2017-2018 flu season, which had high rates of flu testing, resulted in the 2019-2020 flu burden estimates being lower than those estimated earlier.\nIn addition to expected changes in available data on testing practices and patients hospitalized for flu, there were unexpected data delays due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in Spring 2020. The method used to estimate flu-related deaths relies on additional data from FluSurv-NET and the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) (data on cause of death and numbers of deaths that occur inside versus outside of the hospital). The additional mortality data from FluSurv-NET are typically not available for up to 2 years after the end of a flu season. However, data from FluSurv-NET that is usually available at the end of flu season was delayed in 2020 due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe 2019-2020 estimates that are presented here remain preliminary because not all of the data needed for final estimates are available. When additional data become available, these estimates will be updated again, and the results may change.\nMore answers to frequently asked questions about CDC\u2019s influenza burden estimates are available.\n\n\nTable 1: Estimated influenza disease burden, by age group \u2014 United States, 2019-2020 influenza season\n\n\n\nSymptomatic Illnesses\nMedical Visits\nHospitalizations\nDeaths\n\n\nAge group\nEstimate\n95% UI\nEstimate\n95% UI\nEstimate\n95% UI\nEstimate\n95%UI\n\n\n\n\n0-4 yrs\n4,291,677\n(3,065,436, 8,247,015)\n2,875,424\n(2,021,018, 5,544,822)\n29,920\n(21,371, 57,495)\n254\n(84, 554)\n\n\n5-17 yrs\n8,214,257\n(6,551,246, 11,351,951))\n4,271,413\n(3,315,969, 6,011,703)\n22,523\n(17,963, 31,126)\n180\n(35, 439)\n\n\n18-49 yrs\n15,325,708\n(11,798,086, 22,121,677)\n5,670,512\n(4,214,299, 8,383,456)\n86,023\n(66,223, 124,169)\n2,669\n(1,719, 4,601)\n\n\n50-64 yrs\n8,416,702\n(6,918,420, 10,835,295))\n3,619,182\n(2,832,003, 4,780,110)\n89,257\n(73,368, 114,905)\n5,133\n(3,534, 8,750)\n\n\n65+ yrs\n1,946,161\n(1,480,075, 2,883,659)\n1,089,850\n(797,945, 1,621,738)\n176,924\n(134,552, 262,151)\n13,673\n(10,298, 19,568)\n\n\nAll ages\n38,194,505\n(33,672,529, 47,034,054)\n17,526,381\n(15,371,515, 21,930,946)\n404,646\n(352,913, 503,531)\n21,909\n(17,970, 29,053)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: Estimated rates of influenza-associated disease outcomes, per 100,000, by age group \u2014 United States, 2019-2020 influenza season\n\n\n\nIllness rate\nMedical visit rate\nHospitalization rate\nMortality rate\n\n\nAge group\nEstimate\n95% UI\nEstimate\n95% UI\nEstimate\n95% UI\nEstimate\n95% UI\n\n\n\n\n0-4 yrs\n21,922.40\n(15,658.6, 42,126.7)\n14,688.00\n(10,323.6, 28,323.6)\n152.8\n(109.2, 293.7)\n1.3\n(0.4, 2.8)\n\n\n5-17 yrs\n15,364.50\n(12,253.9, 21,233.5)\n7,989.60\n( 6,202.4, 11,244.7)\n42.1\n(33.6, 58.2)\n0.3\n(0.1, 0.8)\n\n\n18-49 yrs\n11,088.20\n( 8,536.0, 16,005.1)\n4,102.60\n( 3,049.1, 6,065.5)\n62.2\n(47.9, 89.8)\n1.9\n(1.2, 3.3)\n\n\n50-64 yrs\n13,375.60\n(10,994.6, 17,219.2)\n5,751.50\n( 4,500.6, 7,596.4)\n141.8\n(116.6, 182.6)\n8.2\n(5.6, 13.9)\n\n\n65+ yrs\n3,600.10\n( 2,737.9, 5,334.4)\n2,016.10\n( 1,476.1, 3,000.0)\n327.3\n(248.9, 484.9)\n25.3\n(19.1, 36.2)\n\n\n\n\n\u202095% Uncertainty intervals\n*Some of the data used to calculate burden estimates are incomplete or not yet available.

The methods used to calculate the estimates have been described previously (1, 2, 6) and are outlined briefly below. CDC uses the estimates of the impact of influenza vaccination to inform policy and communications promoting influenza vaccination as the best way to prevent influenza.\n2019\u20132020 Estimates\nCDC estimates that during the 2019\u20132020 season 38 million people were ill, 18 million people went to a health care provider, 400,000 were hospitalized, and 22,000 died with influenza (7). The season was characterized by two consecutive waves of activity, beginning with influenza B viruses and followed by A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses. Overall, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were the most commonly reported influenza viruses this season. The number of influenza-associated illnesses, medically attended illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths were lower than some more recent seasons and similar to other seasons during which influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses dominated (8).\nInfluenza vaccination prevented an estimated 7.52 million illnesses, 3.69 million medical visits, 105,000 hospitalizations, and 6,300 deaths due to influenza during the 2019-2020 season. The number and proportion of influenza-associated hospitalizations prevented by vaccination during 2019\u20132020 varied by age group, due to age-specific differences in influenza burden, vaccine coverage, and vaccine effectiveness. Vaccination prevented the lowest proportion of illnesses among adults aged 18 to 49 years, the age group in which vaccination coverage is lowest, and among children aged 5-17 years, for whom vaccine effectiveness was low for both influenza B and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses. Vaccination prevented the greatest proportion of outcomes among children aged 6 months to 4 years, an age group in which there was high vaccine uptake and the vaccine effectiveness was greatest.\nInfluenza vaccination is the best way to protect against influenza and associated complications; however, more effective or longer lasting influenza vaccines are needed. Several efforts are currently underway to understand and investigate factors that contribute to reduced or increased vaccine effectiveness and inform changes to vaccine composition, formulations, or production (9-11).\nImprovements in vaccine coverage could also provide a greater public health benefit, producing even greater reductions in illnesses and demands for resources from the health system. During influenza season, the health care system, including outpatient clinics, emergency departments, and hospitals, experience high patient volumes. Any reduction in influenza-associated medical visits and hospitalizations will reduce demands on the healthcare system stressed by the COVID-19 pandemic and improve healthcare providers\u2019 abilities to provide the best care. Strategies to improve influenza vaccine coverage include: using patient reminder/recall systems aided by immunization information systems; expanding access to vaccination at pharmacies, workplaces, and schools; and organizing mobile and/or outdoor vaccination clinics that would allow for social distancing among patients and healthcare providers.\nConclusion\nCDC estimates that influenza vaccination during the 2019\u20132020 influenza season prevented 7.52 million illnesses, 3.69 million medical visits, 105,000 hospitalizations, and 6,300 deaths associated with influenza. This report underscores the benefits of the current vaccination program, but highlights areas where improvements in vaccine uptake and vaccine effectiveness could deliver even greater benefits to the public\u2019s health.\nLimitations\nThese estimates are subject to several limitations. First, influenza vaccination coverage estimates were derived from reports by survey respondents, not vaccination records, and are subject to recall bias. These coverage estimates are based on telephone surveys with relatively low response rates; nonresponse bias may remain after weighting for the survey design. Estimates of the number of persons vaccinated based on these survey data have often exceeded the actual number of doses distributed, indicating that coverage estimates used in this report may overestimate the numbers of illnesses and hospitalizations averted by vaccination. The model of averted illness calculates outcomes directly prevented among persons who were vaccinated. If indirect protection from decreased exposure to infectious persons in a partially vaccinated population (i.e., herd immunity) also occurred, the model would underestimate the number of illnesses and hospitalizations prevented by vaccination. Estimates of the averted burden in older adults, aged \u226565 years, do not reflect the increasing use of high-dose or adjuvanted influenza vaccines, which may have higher effectiveness compared with standard vaccines; nor does the estimate reflect that vaccine effectiveness might continue to decrease with age, reaching very low levels among the oldest adults who also have the highest rates of influenza vaccination. Finally, because the data and methods used to make these calculations are continually updated, current estimates are preliminary and will be updated when final data are available.\nPrevious Estimates\nPrevious estimates of the burden of illness, medical visits, hospitalizations, and deaths related to influenza and prevented by influenza vaccination are available online and in publications (1-5). \u00a0Past seasons\u2019 estimates of influenza disease burden averted by vaccination, using the same methodology as for the 2019-2020 season, are available to provide context for the current season\u2019s estimates.\n2019-2020 Tables for Influenza Burden and Burden-Averted Estimates\n\n\nTable 1: Influenza vaccine coverage, by age group \u2014 United States 2019\u20132020 influenza season\n\n\n\nVaccine coverage *\u00a0\nVaccine effectiveness against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09\u2020\nVaccine effectiveness against influenza B/Victoria\u2020 \n\n\nAge Group\n%\n95% CI\n%\n95% CI\n%\n95% CI\n\n\n\n6 months-4 years\n\n75.5\n74.5\u201376.5\n28\n-6\u201352\n57\n34\u201372\n\n\n\n5-17 yrs\n\n60.2\n59.5\u201360.9\n22\n-4\u201341\n35\n18\u201348\n\n\n\n18-49 yrs\n\n38.4\n37.6\u201339.2\n26\n9\u201339\n45\n30\u201356\n\n\n\n50-64 yrs\n\n50.6\n49.2\u201352.0\n40\n20\u201356\n44\n0\u201368\n\n\n\n\u226565 years\n\n69.8\n68.6\u201371.0\n42\n9\u201364\n34\n-40\u201369\n\n\n\n\n*Estimates from FluVaxView.

Reported hospitalization rates were adjusted using a multiplier to correct for underreporting, which is calculated from the percent of persons hospitalized with respiratory illness who were tested for influenza and the average sensitivity of influenza tests used in the surveillance hospitals. These values were measured from data collected during eight post-pandemic seasons; estimates of underreporting of influenza-related hospitalizations\nAdjusted rates were applied to the U.S. population by age group to calculate the numbers of influenza-associated hospitalizations. The numbers of influenza illnesses were then estimated from hospitalizations based on previously measured ratios that reflect the estimated number of ill persons per hospitalization in each age group (5).\nThe numbers of persons seeking medical care for influenza were then calculated using age group-specific data on the percentages of persons with a respiratory illness who sought medical care, which were estimated from results of the 2010 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey (14).\nAll estimates were rounded to three significant digits.\n\u00a0\nHow does CDC estimate the number of influenza-associated outcomes that were prevented with influenza vaccination?\nThe annual estimates of influenza vaccination coverage by month during each season and the final end-of-season vaccine effectiveness measurements were used to estimate how many persons were not protected by vaccination during the season and thus were at risk for these outcomes.\nThe rate of each outcome among persons at risk was then used to estimate the number of influenza-associated outcomes that would have been expected in the same population if no one had been protected by vaccination. Finally, the averted outcomes attributable to vaccination were calculated as the difference between outcomes in the hypothetical unvaccinated population and the observed vaccinated population.\nEstimates of 2019\u20132020 influenza vaccination coverage by month from July 2019 through April 2020, were based on self-report or parental report of vaccination status using data from the National Immunization Survey for children aged 6 months-17 years and Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey data for adults aged \u226518 years (12).\nVaccine effectiveness estimates for the 2019\u20132020 season were derived from the US Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Network, a group of five academic institutions that conduct annual vaccine effectiveness studies. (13) The network estimates the effectiveness of vaccination for preventing influenza diagnosed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction-positive testing among persons with acute respiratory illness of \u22647 days duration seen in hospitals, emergency departments, or outpatient clinics in communities in\nCalculations were stratified by month of the year to account for annual variations in the timing of disease and vaccination and then summed across the whole season. The prevented fraction was calculated as the number of averted illnesses divided by the total illnesses that would have been expected in an unvaccinated population.\nThe Benefits of Flu Vaccination 2019-2020 Infographic\n\nFull Sized Infographic\nThe Benefits of Flu Vaccination 2019-2020 Infographic (Text Version)\nNearly 52% of the U.S. population aged 6 months and older got a flu vaccine during the 2019-2020 flu season, and this prevented an estimated:\n7.5 million flu illnesses, more than the combined population of Kentucky and Kansas.\n105,000 flu hospitalizations, enough people to fill Michigan Stadium at the University of Michigan.\n6,300 flu deaths, equivalent to saving about 17 lives per day over the course of a year.\nCDC logo\nGet vaccinated.\nwww.cdc.gov/flu \u200b\nReferences\n\nKostova D, Reed C, Finelli L, Cheng PY, Gargiullo PM, Shay DK, et al.

Clinicians may also wish to consult the IDSA antiviral treatment and antiviral chemoprophylaxis recommendationsexternal icon, and the ATS-IDSA Adult CAP Guidelinesexternal icon.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNeed to fill a prescription for flu antivirals?\nexternal iconFind Flu MedicationPriority Groups for Antiviral Treatment of InfluenzaAntiviral treatment is recommended as soon as possible for any patient with suspected or confirmed influenza who:\n\nis hospitalized;\nhas severe, complicated, or progressive illness; or\nis at higher risk for influenza complications.\n\nDecisions about starting antiviral treatment for patients with suspected influenza should not wait for laboratory confirmation of influenza virus infection. Empiric antiviral treatment should be started as soon as possible in the above priority groups.\nClinicians can consider early empiric antiviral treatment of non-high-risk outpatients with suspected influenza [e.g., influenza-like illness (fever with either cough or sore throat)] based upon clinical judgement, if treatment can be initiated within 48 hours of illness onset.\nAntiviral Drug Options\n\nFor hospitalized patients with suspected or confirmed influenza, initiation of antiviral treatment with oral or enterically-administered oseltamivir is recommended as soon as possible.\nFor outpatients with complications or progressive disease and suspected or confirmed influenza (e.g., pneumonia, or exacerbation of underlying chronic medical conditions), initiation of antiviral treatment with oral oseltamivir is recommended as soon as possible.\nFor outpatients with suspected or confirmed uncomplicated influenza, oral oseltamivir, inhaled zanamivir, intravenous peramivir, or oral baloxavir\u00a0may be used for treatment, depending upon approved age groups and contraindications. In one randomized controlled trial, baloxavir had greater efficacy than oseltamivir in adolescents and adults with influenza B virus infection (Ison, 2020external icon).\n\nMoreCo-circulation of Influenza Viruses and SARS-CoV-2During periods of community co-circulation of influenza viruses and SARS-CoV-2, empiric antiviral treatment of influenza is recommended as soon as possible for the following priority groups: a) hospitalized patients with respiratory illness; b) outpatients with severe, complicated, or progressive respiratory illness; and c) outpatients at higher risk for influenza complications who present with any acute respiratory illness symptoms (with or without fever).\n\nInfluenza and COVID-19 have overlapping signs and symptoms. Testing can help distinguish between influenza virus infection and SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, clinicians should not wait for the results of influenza testing (view Table 3), SARS-CoV-2 testing, or multiplex molecular assays that detect influenza A and B viruses and SARS-CoV-2 (view Table 4) to initiate empiric antiviral treatment for influenza in the above priority groups.\nCo-infection with influenza A or B viruses and SARS-CoV-2 can occur and should be considered, particularly in hospitalized patients with severe respiratory disease.\n\nClinicians should be aware that a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result does not preclude influenza virus infection. For hospitalized patients with suspected influenza who are started on empiric antiviral treatment with oseltamivir, use of influenza molecular assays (view Table 3) or multiplex assays that detect both influenza viruses and SARS-CoV-2 (view Table 4) can inform clinical management.\nClinicians should be aware that a positive influenza test result does not preclude SARS-CoV-2 infection. For hospitalized patients with a positive influenza test result, antiviral treatment of influenza with oseltamivir should be started as soon as possible, and clinicians should also follow guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (view community acquired pneumonia treatment guidance for adults: Metlay, 2019external icon) and other respiratory infections, including SARS-CoV-2 infection (view\u00a0NIH COVID-19 treatment guidelinesexternal icon and IDSA COVID-19 treatment guidelinesexternal icon) if clinically indicated, while awaiting SARS-CoV-2 testing results. Oseltamivir does not have in-vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2 (Choy, 2020external icon).\n\n\nClinicians can utilize telemedicine in place of office visits for patients with acute respiratory illness. It may be useful for providers to implement phone triage lines to enable high-risk patients to discuss symptoms over the phone. Please see the Algorithm to Assist in Medical Office Telephone Evaluation of Patients with Possible Influenza.\nPatients at\u00a0higher risk for influenza complications should be advised to call their provider as soon as possible if they have acute respiratory illness symptoms (with or without fever)\u00a0for consideration of infection with influenza A or B viruses (and early antiviral treatment), SARS-CoV-2, and other respiratory pathogens.\nClinicians can consider starting early (\u226448 hours after illness onset) empiric antiviral treatment of non-high-risk outpatients with suspected influenza [e.g., influenza-like illness (fever with either cough or sore throat)], based upon clinical judgement, including without an office visit. SARS-CoV-2 and other etiologies of influenza-like illness should also be considered.\nNational Institutes of Health (NIH) COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines: Influenza and COVID-19 are availableexternal icon.\nClinical algorithms for the testing and treatment of influenza when SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses are circulating are also available.\n\n\nOpen All Close All\n\n\nOverview of Influenza Antiviral Medications\n\n\n\nAntiviral medications with activity against influenza viruses are an important adjunct to influenza vaccine in the control of influenza.\n\nInfluenza antiviral prescription drugs can be used to\u00a0treat\u00a0influenza, and some can be used to\u00a0prevent\u00a0influenza.\nSix licensed prescription influenza antiviral drugs are approved in the United States.\n\nFour influenza antiviral medications approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are recommended for use in the United States during the 2020-2021 influenza season.\n\nThree drugs are chemically related antiviral medications known as neuraminidase inhibitors that block the viral neuraminidase enzyme and have activity against both influenza A and B viruses:\u00a0 oral\u00a0oseltamivir\u00a0phosphate\u00a0(available as a generic version or under the trade name Tamiflu\u00ae), inhaled\u00a0zanamivir\u00a0(trade name Relenza\u00ae), and intravenous\u00a0peramivir\u00a0(trade name Rapivab\u00ae).\nThe fourth drug is oral\u00a0baloxavir marboxil\u00a0(trade name Xofluza\u00ae), which is active against both influenza A and B viruses but has a different mechanism of action than neuraminidase inhibitors.\u00a0 Baloxavir is a cap-dependent endonuclease inhibitor that interferes with viral RNA transcription and blocks virus replication.\nMore information regarding the four recommended antiviral medications is available: Table 1.\n\n\n\n\nAmantadine and rimantadine are antiviral drugs in a class of medications known as adamantanes, which target the M2 ion channel protein of influenza A viruses. Therefore, these medications are active against influenza A viruses, but not influenza B viruses. As in recent past seasons, there continues to be high levels of resistance (>99%) to adamantanes among circulating influenza A(H3N2) and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (\u201c2009 H1N1\u201d) viruses. Therefore, amantadine and rimantadine are not recommended for antiviral treatment or chemoprophylaxis of currently circulating influenza A viruses.\nAntiviral resistance and reduced susceptibility to the neuraminidase inhibitors and to baloxavir among circulating influenza viruses is currently very low, but this can change.\n\nFor weekly surveillance data on susceptibility of circulating influenza viruses to antivirals in the U.S. this season, see the FluView Weekly U.S. Influenza Surveillance Report.\n\n\nInfluenza viruses with reduced susceptibility or resistance to antivirals can occur sporadically or emerge during or after antiviral treatment in some patients (e.g., immunocompromised). Oseltamivir resistance in influenza A(H3N2) and A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses can develop during treatment, particularly in young children (Roosenhoff, 2019external icon; Lina, 2018external icon;), and immunocompromised persons (Memoli, 2014)external icon. Following treatment with baloxavir, emergence of viruses with molecular markers associated with reduced susceptibility to baloxavir has been observed in clinical trials in immunocompetent children and adults, with higher detection among baloxavir-treated pediatric patients aged <12 years compared with adults (Hayden, 2018external icon;\u00a0Omoto, 2018external icon; Hirostu, 2019external icon; Uehara, 2019external icon; Takashita, 2019external icon).\n\nHuman-to-human transmission of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses with an H275Y mutation in viral neuraminidase conferring resistance to oseltamivir has been reported among severely immunocompromised patients in hospital units,\u00a0 (Gooskens, 2009external icon; Chen, 2011external icon;) and in the community (Hibino, 2017external icon; Le, 2008;external icon Hurt, 2011external icon; Hurt, 2012external icon; Takashita, 2013)external icon, but currently appears to be uncommon.\nLimited human-to-human transmission of influenza A(H3N2) virus with reduced susceptibility to baloxavir has been reported sporadically in Japanese children (Takashita, 2019external icon; Takashita 2019external icon; Imai, 2019external icon), but currently appears to be uncommon.\n\n\nClinical trials and observational data show that early antiviral treatment can shorten the duration of fever and illness symptoms, and may reduce the risk of some\u00a0complications from influenza\u00a0(e.g., otitis media in young children, pneumonia, and respiratory failure).\n\nEarly treatment of hospitalized adult influenza patients with oseltamivir has been reported to reduce death in some observational studies.\nIn hospitalized children, early antiviral treatment with oseltamivir has been reported to shorten the duration of hospitalization in observational studies.\nClinical benefit is greatest when antiviral treatment is administered early, especially within 48 hours of influenza illness onset in clinical trials and observational studies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Antiviral Medications Recommended for Treatment and Chemoprophylaxis of Influenza\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.

Although not part of the FDA-approved indications, use of oral oseltamivir for treatment of influenza in infants less than 14 days old, and for chemoprophylaxis in infants 3 months to 1 year, is recommended by the CDC and the American Academy of Pediatrics. If a child is younger than 3 months old, use of oseltamivir for chemoprophylaxis is not recommended unless the situation is judged critical due to limited data in this age group.\n2\u00a0Self-injury or delirium; mainly reported among Japanese pediatric patients.\n3\u00a0Inhaled zanamivir is contraindicated in patients with underlying airways disease such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and those with a history of allergy to lactose or milk protein.\n4\u00a0Intravenous peramivir is approved by the FDA for treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza within 2 days of illness onset in people 2 years and older. Peramivir efficacy is based on clinical trials versus placebo in which the predominant influenza virus type was influenza A; in one trial, a very limited number of subjects infected with influenza B virus were enrolled.\n5 There are no data for use of peramivir for chemoprophylaxis of influenza. On November 23, 2020, FDA approved baloxavir for post-exposure prophylaxis of influenza in persons aged 12 years and older. One study of baloxavir post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) of influenza in household members aged 12 years and older (73% received baloxavir within 24 hours of onset of symptoms in the index household case who received antiviral treatment) reported that the risk of laboratory-confirmed influenza was significantly lower, by 86%, among those who received baloxavir PEP than among those who received placebo (1.9% [7 of 374] vs. 13.6% [51 of 375]; adjusted risk ratio, 0.14; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.06 to 0.30; P<0.001).\n6 Oral baloxavir marboxil is approved by the FDA for treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza within 2 days of illness onset in people 12 years and older who are otherwise healthy, or at high risk of developing influenza-related complications. The safety and efficacy of baloxavir for the treatment of influenza have been established in pediatric patients 12 years and older weighing at least 40 kg.. Baloxavir efficacy for initial FDA approval in October 2018 was based on clinical trials in previously healthy outpatients 12 to 64 years old (Hayden, 2018external icon). Single-dose baloxavir treatment was superior to placebo and had similar clinical efficacy in time to alleviation of symptoms to a 5-day treatment course of oseltamivir. In October 2019, FDA approved an indication for baloxavir treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza within 2 days of illness onset in people 12 years and older at high risk of developing influenza-related complications, based upon the findings of a clinical trial (Ison, 2020external icon; Baloxavir marboxil (Xofluza)\u00a0 pdf icon[package insert]external icon. U.S. Food and Drug Administration website; 2019). In this clinical trial of early initiation of antiviral treatment for uncomplicated influenza in high-risk patients, baloxavir was superior to placebo and had similar overall efficacy to oseltamivir in the time to alleviation of symptoms. For patients with influenza B virus infection, baloxavir significantly reduced the median time to improvement of symptoms compared with oseltamivir by more than 24 hours. However, there are no available data for baloxavir treatment of influenza in pregnant women, immunocompromised people, or in people with severe influenza. There are no available data from clinical trials for baloxavir treatment of hospitalized patients with influenza.\n\n\n\n\nSummary of Influenza Antiviral Treatment Recommendations\n\n\n\n\nAntiviral treatment is recommended as early as possible for any patient with confirmed or suspected influenza who:\n\nis hospitalized;*\nhas severe, complicated, or progressive illness;* or\nis at higher risk for influenza complications.\n\n\n\n*Note: Oral oseltamivir is the recommended antiviral for patients with severe, complicated, or progressive illness who are not hospitalized, and for hospitalized influenza patients.\n\nAntiviral treatment also can be considered for any previously healthy, symptomatic outpatient not at high risk for influenza complications, who is diagnosed with confirmed or suspected influenza, on the basis of clinical judgment, if treatment can be initiated within 48 hours of illness onset.\n\nFigure: Guide for considering influenza testing and treatment when influenza viruses are circulating in the community (regardless of influenza vaccination history)1\n\nComplete footnotes for this algorithm are available.\n\nClinical judgment, on the basis of the patient\u2019s disease severity and progression, age, underlying medical conditions, likelihood of influenza, and time since onset of symptoms, is important when making antiviral treatment decisions for high-risk outpatients.\nWhen indicated, antiviral treatment should be started as soon as possible after illness onset, ideally within 48 hours of symptom onset. However, antiviral treatment might have some benefits in patients with severe, complicated or progressive illness, and in hospitalized patients when started after 48 hours of illness onset.\n\nObservational studies in hospitalized patients with influenza have reported that clinical benefit is greatest when oseltamivir is started within 48 hours of illness onset (Hsu, 2012external icon; Louie, 2013external icon; Muthuri, 2013external icon; Muthuri, 2014external icon). However, some studies suggest that antiviral treatment might still be beneficial in hospitalized patients when started up to 4 or 5 days after illness onset (Louie, 2012external icon; Yu, 2011external icon). Antiviral treatment of pregnant women (of any trimester) with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection has been shown to be most beneficial in preventing respiratory failure and death when started within less than 3 days of illness onset, but still provided benefit when started 3\u20134 days after onset compared to 5 or more days (Siston, 2010external icon).\u00a0One observational study reported that initiating neuraminidase inhibitor treatment within 6 hours after hospital admission was associated with shorter duration of hospitalization versus starting antiviral treatment later (Katzen, 2018external icon). Another observational study reported that neuraminidase inhibitor treatment initiated at the time of hospitalization was associated with a significant reduction in hospital length of stay in patients with clinically suspected or laboratory-confirmed influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection compared with later initiation or no NAI treatment (Venkatesan, 2019external icon).\n\n\nDecisions about starting antiviral treatment should not wait for laboratory confirmation of influenza (see resources regarding Clinical Description and Lab Diagnosis of Influenza\u00a0for more information on influenza diagnostic testing).\n\nClinical benefit is greatest when antiviral treatment is started as close to illness onset as possible.\n\n\nWhile influenza vaccination is the best way to prevent influenza illness, a history of influenza vaccination does not rule out the possibility of influenza virus infection in an ill patient with clinical signs and symptoms compatible with influenza.\nAntiviral treatment also can be considered for any previously healthy, symptomatic outpatient not at high risk with confirmed or suspected influenza on the basis of clinical judgment, if treatment can be initiated within 48 hours of illness onset. Multiple randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses of RCTs have demonstrated efficacy of early initiation of treatment (started within 48 hours of illness onset) with neuraminidase inhibitors in reducing duration of fever and illness symptoms compared with placebo in otherwise healthy children and adults with uncomplicated influenza (Hayden, 1997external icon;\u00a0Monto, 1999external icon;\u00a0Monto, 1999external icon;\u00a0Nicholson, 2000external icon;\u00a0Hedrick, 2000external icon;\u00a0Treanor, 2000external icon;\u00a0Whitley, 2001external icon;\u00a0Heinonen, 2010external icon;\u00a0Fry, 2014external icon;\u00a0Whitley, 2015external icon;\u00a0Kohno, 2010external icon;\u00a0Hsu, 2012external icon;\u00a0Jefferson, 2014external icon;\u00a0Whitley, 2015external icon;,\u00a0Dobson, 2015external icon;\u00a0Malosh, 2017external icon).\n\nOne randomized clinical trial in children with uncomplicated influenza demonstrated a modest reduction in duration of symptoms and influenza virus shedding in patients initiating treatment after 48 hours; post hoc analysis suggested that oseltamivir treatment initiated 72 hours after illness onset reduced symptoms by one day compared with placebo (Fry, 2014external icon).\n\n\nFor outpatients with acute uncomplicated influenza, oral oseltamivir, inhaled zanamivir, intravenous peramivir, or oral baloxavir may be used for treatment.\n\nThe recommended treatment course for uncomplicated influenza is two doses per day of oral oseltamivir or inhaled zanamivir for 5 days, or one dose of intravenous peramivir or oral baloxavir for 1 day.\nOnly one randomized clinical trial has compared baloxavir to oseltamivir for treatment of influenza B. This study found that baloxavir treatment was superior to oseltamivir among outpatients with influenza B virus infection (Ison, 2020external icon).\nCDC does not recommend use of baloxavir for treatment of influenza in pregnant women or breastfeeding mothers. There are no available efficacy or safety data for baloxavir in pregnant women, and there are no available data on the presence of baloxavir in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production.\nCDC does not recommend use of baloxavir for monotherapy of influenza in severely immunosuppressed persons. There are no available efficacy, safety, or resistance data for baloxavir monotherapy of influenza\u00a0in severely immunosuppressed patients and emergence of resistance during treatment is a concern because of prolonged influenza viral replication in these patients.\nThere are no available data on the use of baloxavir for treatment of influenza more than 2 days after illness onset.\n\n\nOral oseltamivir is preferred for treatment of pregnant women (Rasmussenexternal icon,; 2011external icon). Pregnant women are recommended to receive the same antiviral dosing as non-pregnant people. Multiple recent studies have reported safe use of neuraminidase inhibitors during pregnancy (Dunstan, 2014external icon;\u00a0Xie, 2013external icon;\u00a0Saito, 2013external icon;\u00a0Wollenhaupt, 2014external icon;\u00a0Beau, 2014external icon;\u00a0Svensson, 2011external icon;\u00a0Greer, 2010external icon;\u00a0Graner, 2017external icon);\u00a0Ehrenstien, 2018external icon;\u00a0Chambers, 2019external icon; Bennekom, 2019external icon; ACOG Committee, 2018external icon). See Recommendations for Obstetric Health Care Providers Related to Use of Antiviral Medications in the Treatment and Prevention of Influenza\u00a0for additional information. Baloxavir is not recommended for the treatment of influenza in pregnant women, as there are no available efficacy or safety data for baloxavir in this population.\nFor patients with severe or complicated illness with suspected or confirmed influenza (e.g., pneumonia, or exacerbation of underlying chronic medical condition) who are not hospitalized, antiviral treatment with oral or enterically-administered oseltamivir is recommended as soon as possible.\u00a0There are insufficient data for inhaled zanamivir and intravenous peramivir in patients with severe influenza disease. There are no available data from clinical trials on use of baloxavir treatment in patients with severe influenza disease.\n\n\n\n\nPeople at Higher risk for Influenza Complications Recommended for Antiviral Treatment\n\n\n\n\nchildren younger than 2 years;1\nadults 65 years and older;\npeople with chronic pulmonary (including asthma), cardiovascular (except hypertension alone), renal, hepatic, hematological (including sickle cell disease), and metabolic disorders (including diabetes mellitus), or neurologic and neurodevelopment conditions (including disorders of the brain, spinal cord, peripheral nerve, and muscle, such as cerebral palsy, epilepsy [seizure disorders], stroke, intellectual disability, moderate to severe developmental delay, muscular dystrophy, or spinal cord injury);\npeople with immunosuppression, including that caused by medications or by HIV infection;\nwomen who are pregnant or postpartum (within 2 weeks after delivery);\npeople younger than 19 years old who are receiving long-term aspirin- or salicylate-containing medications\nAmerican Indians/Alaska Natives;\npeople who are extremely obese (i.e., body mass index is equal to or greater than 40); and\nresidents of nursing homes and other chronic care facilities.\n\n1 Although all children younger than 5 years old are considered at higher risk for complications from influenza, the highest risk is for those younger than 2 years old, with the highest hospitalization and death rates among infants younger than 6 months old. Because many children with mild febrile respiratory illness might have other viral infections (e.g., respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus, or human metapneumovirus), knowledge of other respiratory viruses as well as influenza virus strains circulating in the community is important for treatment decisions.\n\n\n\nTreatment Considerations for Patients Hospitalized with Suspected or Confirmed Influenza\n\n\n\nTreatment of patients with severe influenza (e.g., those requiring hospitalization) presents multiple challenges. The effect of specific antiviral strategies in serious or life-threatening influenza is not established from clinical trials conducted to support licensure of oral oseltamivir, inhaled zanamivir, intravenous peramivir, or oral baloxavir, as those studies were conducted primarily among previously healthy outpatients with uncomplicated illness. No randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials have been conducted of neuraminidase inhibitors for treatment of influenza in hospitalized patients. However, a number of observational studies in hospitalized influenza patients have shown clinical benefit of neuraminidase inhibitor antiviral treatment compared with no treatment, particularly when started within two days of influenza illness, including reducing the duration of hospitalization or risk of death (Hiba, 2011external icon;\u00a0Coffin, 2011external icon;\u00a0Hsu, 2012external icon;\u00a0Louie, 2013external icon;\u00a0Muthuri, 2013external icon; Muthuri, 2014external icon; Miyakawa, 2019external icon; Lytras, 2019external icon; Katzen, 2019;external icon Reacher, 2019external icon).\u00a0 In addition, some observational studies have reported that oral oseltamivir treatment started 4 and 5 days after illness onset in \u00a0patients hospitalized with suspected or confirmed influenza was \u00a0associated with lower risk for severe outcomes (EH Lee, 2010external icon;\u00a0N Lee, 2008external icon;\u00a0N Lee, 2010external icon;\u00a0Louie, 2012external icon;\u00a0McGeer, 2007external icon;\u00a0Siston, 2010external icon), although one report found this benefit only in hospitalized adult patients in the ICU (Muthuri, 2014external icon). A small number of observational studies and one meta-analysis of observational studies of hospitalized influenza patients reported that neuraminidase inhibitor treatment did not have survival benefit (Choi, 2017external icon;\u00a0Wolkewitz, 2016external icon;\u00a0Heneghan, 2016external icon).\nThe following recommendations do not necessarily represent FDA-approved uses of antiviral products but are based on published observational studies and expert opinion and are subject to change as the developmental status of investigational products and the epidemiologic and virologic features of influenza change over time.\n\nFor hospitalized patients with suspected or confirmed influenza, initiation of antiviral treatment with oral or enterically-administered oseltamivir is recommended as soon as possible.\u00a0Antiviral treatment might be effective in reducing morbidity and mortality in hospitalized influenza patients, especially adults, even if treatment is started more than 48 hours after onset of illness.\nInhaled zanamivir and oral baloxavir are not recommended because of the lack of data in hospitalized influenza patients. There are also insufficient data for treatment of hospitalized influenza patients with intravenous peramivir. A\u00a0randomized clinical trialexternal icon of baloxavir treatment of influenza in hospitalized patients aged 12 years and older is in-progress.\nFor patients with lower respiratory tract disease, lower respiratory tract specimens, such as bronchoalveolar lavage fluid or endotracheal aspirates, are preferred; an oropharyngeal (throat) swab may be collected if lower respiratory specimens are not available. Testing of lower respiratory tract specimens may detect influenza viruses when testing of upper respiratory tract specimens is negative. Multiple respiratory tract specimens collected on different days should be tested if influenza virus infection is suspected but a definitive diagnosis has not been made.\nThe optimal duration and dosing of antiviral treatment are uncertain for severe or complicated influenza. Treatment regimens might need to be altered to fit the clinical circumstances. For example, clinical judgment should be the guide regarding the need to extend daily treatment regimens longer than 5 days for patients whose illness is prolonged. Critically ill patients with respiratory failure can have prolonged influenza viral replication in the lower respiratory tract and might benefit from longer duration of treatment.\n\nClinical judgment and virologic testing of lower respiratory tract specimens by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) should guide decisions to consider treatment regimens longer than 5 days for hospitalized influenza patients with severe and prolonged illness.\nLonger treatment regimens might be necessary in immunosuppressed people who may have prolonged influenza viral replication. Such patients are at risk of emergence of influenza viruses with reduced susceptibility or antiviral resistance during or after antiviral treatment.\nA higher dose of oral or enterically-administered oseltamivir has been recommended by some experts (e.g., 150 mg twice daily in adults with normal renal function) for treatment of influenza in immunocompromised patients and in severely ill hospitalized patients. However, oral or enterically administered oseltamivir has been reported to be adequately absorbed in critically ill adults, with standard doses producing therapeutic blood levels (Ariano, 2010external icon), and available data suggest that higher dosing may not provide additional clinical benefit (Abdel-Ghafar, 2008external icon;\u00a0Ariano, 2010external icon;\u00a0Kumar, 2010external icon;\u00a0Lee, 2013external icon;\u00a0South East Asia Infectious Disease Clinical Research Network, 2013external icon). Studies indicate that the exposure to oseltamivir carboxylate (the active metabolite of oseltamivir) is similar between obese and non-obese subjects for both 75 mg and 150 mg doses given twice daily (Ariano, 2010external icon;\u00a0Jittamala, 2014external icon;\u00a0Pai, 2011external icon;\u00a0Thorne-Humphrey, 2011external icon).\n\n\nLimited data suggest that oseltamivir administered orally or by oro/naso gastric tube is well absorbed in critically ill influenza patients, including those receiving continuous renal replacement therapy, and/or on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (Ariano, 2010external icon;\u00a0Eyler, 2012aexternal icon;\u00a0Eyler, 2012bexternal icon;\u00a0Giraud, 2011external icon;\u00a0Kromdijk, 2013external icon;\u00a0Lemaitre, 2012external icon;\u00a0Mulla, 2013external icon;\u00a0Taylor, 2008external icon).\nFor patients who cannot tolerate or absorb oral or enterically-administered oseltamivir because of suspected or known gastric stasis, malabsorption, or gastrointestinal bleeding, the use of intravenous peramivir should be considered (Lee, 2017external icon;\u00a0deJong, 2014external icon;\u00a0Ison, 2014external icon;\u00a0Ison, 2013external icon).\n\nIn a randomized trial of treatment of influenza in hospitalized patients >6 years old, a significant clinical benefit was not demonstrated for intravenous peramivir at a dosage of 600 mg once daily (10 mg/kg once daily in children) for five days plus standard of care compared with placebo plus standard of care; however, peramivir was generally safe and well tolerated (de Jong, 2014external icon)\n\n\nIt is possible that some influenza viruses may become less susceptible or resistant to oseltamivir and peramivir during antiviral treatment with one of these drugs and remain susceptible to zanamivir; this has been reported most often for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses (Graitcer, 2011; Lackenby, 2011; Memoli, 2010; Nguyen, 2010; Nguyen, 2012) Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses have also emerged that are resistant to all neuraminidase inhibitors, including zanamivir, in highly immunosuppressed patients on prolonged neuraminidase inhibitor treatment (Tamura, 2015external icon;\u00a0L\u2019Huillier, 2015external icon). Resistance and reduced susceptibility of influenza viruses to antiviral drugs can also occur spontaneously, with no known exposure to antiviral medications (Hurt, 2011external icon;\u00a0Takashita, 2013external icon;\u00a0Takashita, 2014external icon).\nIf a hospitalized patient treated with oseltamivir or peramivir manifests progressive lower respiratory symptoms, resistant virus should be considered. However, clinicians should note that failure to improve or clinical deterioration during oseltamivir or peramivir treatment is more likely to be related to the natural history of acute lung injury and inflammatory damage or onset of other complications (e.g., renal failure, septic shock, ventilator-associated pneumonia) than to emergence of oseltamivir or peramivir resistance. Severely immunosuppressed people (e.g., hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients) are at highest risk for emergence of oseltamivir- and peramivir-resistant influenza virus infection during or following oseltamivir and/or peramivir treatment (Hurt, 2012external icon;\u00a0Memoli, 2010external icon). Molecular analyses can detect genetic changes in influenza viruses associated with resistance and reduced susceptibility to oseltamivir and peramivir. The CDC Influenza Division is available for consultation regarding antiviral susceptibility testing as needed. Information about neuraminidase inhibitor susceptibility testing and interpretation of results of neuraminidase inhibition assays is available on the\u00a0WHO websiteexternal icon.\nIntravenous zanamivir is an investigational parenterally administered neuraminidase inhibitor product that has been available in the past through enrollment in a clinical trial or under an emergency investigational new drug (EIND) request to the manufacturer. However, since the 2017-18 season, intravenous zanamivir is no longer available in the United States.\nCareful attention to ventilator and fluid management and to the prevention and treatment of secondary bacterial pneumonia (e.g.,\u00a0S. pneumoniae,\u00a0S. pyogenes, and\u00a0S. aureus, including MRSA) also is critical for severely ill patients (Bautista, 2010external icon;\u00a0Finelli, 2008external icon;\u00a0Hageman, 2006external icon;\u00a0Harper, 2009pdf iconexternal icon;\u00a0Mandell, 2007external icon;\u00a0Mauad, 2010external icon;\u00a0Shieh, 2010external icon).\n\n\n\n\nTable 2.

Although not part of the FDA-approved indications, use of oral oseltamivir for treatment of influenza in infants less than 14 days old, and for chemoprophylaxis in infants 3 months to 1 year of age, is recommended by the CDC and the American Academy of Pediatrics (Committee on Infectious Diseases, 2018external icon).\n3This is the FDA-approved oral oseltamivir treatment dose for infants 14 days and older and less than 1 year old, and provides oseltamivir exposure in children similar to that achieved by the approved dose of 75 mg orally twice daily for adults, as shown in two studies of oseltamivir pharmacokinetics in children (Kimberlin, 2013 [CASG 114], EU study WP22849, FDA Clinical Pharmacology Reviewexternal icon). The American Academy of Pediatrics has recommended an oseltamivir treatment dose of 3.5 mg/kg orally twice daily for infants 9-11 months old, on the basis of data which indicated that a higher dose of 3.5 mg/kg was needed to achieve the protocol-defined targeted exposure for this cohort as defined in the CASG 114 study (Kimberlin, 2013external icon). It is unknown whether this higher dose will improve efficacy or prevent the development of antiviral resistance. However, there is no evidence that the 3.5 mg/kg dose is harmful or causes more adverse events to infants in this age group.\n4Current weight-based dosing recommendations are not appropriate for premature infants. Premature infants might have slower clearance of oral oseltamivir because of immature renal function, and doses recommended for full-term infants might lead to very high drug concentrations in this age group. CDC recommends dosing as also recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics (Committee on Infectious Diseases, 2018external icon): limited data from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Collaborative Antiviral Study Group provide the basis for dosing preterm infants using their postmenstrual age (gestational age + chronological age): 1.0 mg/kg/dose, orally, twice daily, for those <38 weeks postmenstrual age; 1.5 mg/kg/dose, orally, twice daily, for those 38 through 40 weeks postmenstrual age; 3.0 mg/kg/dose, orally, twice daily, for those >40 weeks postmenstrual age.\n5See Special Considerations for Institutional Settings section below for details regarding duration of chemoprophylaxis for outbreaks in institutional settings.\n6Inhaled zanamivir is approved for treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza within 2 days of illness onset with twice-daily dosing in people 7 years and older, and for chemoprophylaxis with once-daily dosing in people 5 years and older.\n7Intravenous peramivir is approved for treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza within 2 days of illness onset with a single dose in people 2 years and older. Daily dosing for a minimum of 5 days was used in clinical trials of hospitalized patients with influenza (de Jong, 2014external icon, Ison, 2014external icon).\n8There are no data for use of peramivir for chemoprophylaxis of influenza. One study of baloxavir post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) of influenza in household members aged 12 years and older (73% received baloxavir within 24 hours of onset of symptoms in the index household case who received antiviral treatment) reported that the risk of laboratory-confirmed influenza was significantly lower, by 86%, among those who received baloxavir PEP than among those who received placebo (1.9% [7 of 374] vs. 13.6% [51 of 375]; adjusted risk ratio, 0.14; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.06 to 0.30; P<0.001) (Ikematsu, 2020external icon).\n9Oral baloxavir marboxil is approved by the FDA for treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza within 2 days of illness onset in people 12 years and older who are otherwise healthy, or at high risk of developing influenza-related complications.\u00a0 (Baloxavir marboxil (Xofluza)\u00a0pdf icon[package insert]external icon. U.S. Food and Drug Administration website; 2019). Baloxavir marboxil should not be administered with dairy products, calcium-fortified beverages, polyvalent cation-containing laxatives, antacids or oral supplements (e.g., calcium, iron, magnesium, selenium, or zinc); co-administration with polyvalent cation-containing products may decrease plasma concentrations of baloxavir which may reduce efficacy. There are no available published data from clinical trials for baloxavir treatment of influenza in patients who are pregnant, immunocompromised, have severe disease, or in hospitalized patients. A randomized clinical trialexternal icon\u00a0of baloxavir treatment of influenza in hospitalized patients 12 years and older is in-progress.\n\n\n\n\nDuration of Treatment or Chemoprophylaxis\n\n\n\n\nTreatment:\u00a0Recommended duration for antiviral treatment is 5 days for oral oseltamivir or inhaled zanamivir. For the treatment of uncomplicated influenza with intravenous peramivir or oral baloxavir, a single dose is recommended. Longer daily dosing (oral oseltamivir or intravenous peramivir) can be considered for patients who remain severely ill after 5 days of treatment.\nChemoprophylaxis: Recommended duration is 7 days (after last known exposure). For control of outbreaks in institutional settings (e.g., long-term care facilities for elderly people and children) and hospitals, CDC recommends antiviral chemoprophylaxis with oral oseltamivir or inhaled zanamivir for a minimum of 2 weeks and continuing up to 1 week after the last known case was identified. Antiviral chemoprophylaxis is recommended for all residents, including those who have received influenza vaccination. Baloxavir is approved for post-exposure prophylaxis (single-dose) of influenza in persons aged 12 years and older.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nChemoprophylaxis\n\n\n\n\nAnnual influenza vaccinationpdf icon is the best way to prevent influenza because vaccination can be given well before influenza virus exposures occur and can provide safe and effective immunity throughout the influenza season.\nNeuraminidase inhibitor antiviral medications are approximately\u00a070%\u00a0to\u00a090%\u00a0effective in preventing influenza against susceptible influenza viruses and are useful adjuncts to influenza vaccination.\nCDC does not recommend widespread or routine use of antiviral medications for chemoprophylaxis except as one of multiple interventions to control institutional influenza outbreaks. Routine use of post-exposure chemoprophylaxis is not recommended; one reason for this is to avoid sub-therapeutic treatment dosing if infection is already established, although the likelihood of emergence of antiviral resistant viruses is unknown.\n\nClinicians may wish to also consult the antiviral chemoprophylaxis recommendations from the Infectious Diseases Society of America (Uyeki, 2019external icon).\n\n\nIn general, CDC does not recommend seasonal or pre-exposure antiviral chemoprophylaxis, but\u00a0antiviral medications can be considered for chemoprophylaxis to prevent influenza in certain situations, such as the following examples:\n\nPrevention of influenza in people at high risk of influenza complications during the first two weeks following vaccination after exposure to a person with influenza.\nPrevention for people at high risk for complications from influenza who cannot receive influenza vaccine due to a contraindication after exposure to a person with influenza.\nPrevention for people with severe immune deficiencies or others who might not respond to influenza vaccination, such as people receiving immunosuppressive medications, after exposure to a person with influenza.\nPatients receiving antiviral chemoprophylaxis should be encouraged to seek medical evaluation as soon as they develop a febrile respiratory illness that might indicate influenza.\n\n\nAn emphasis on close monitoring and early initiation of antiviral treatment if fever and/or respiratory symptoms develop is an alternative to chemoprophylaxis after a suspected exposure for some people.\nTo be effective as chemoprophylaxis, an antiviral medication must be taken each day for the duration of potential exposure to a person with influenza and continued for 7 days after the last known exposure. For people taking antiviral chemoprophylaxis after inactivated influenza vaccination, the recommended duration is until immunity after vaccination develops (antibody development after vaccination takes about two weeks in adults and can take longer in children depending on age and vaccination history).\nAntiviral chemoprophylaxis generally is not recommended if more than 48 hours have elapsed since the first exposure to a person with influenza.\nPatients receiving antiviral chemoprophylaxis should be encouraged to seek medical evaluation as soon as they develop a febrile respiratory illness that might indicate influenza.\n\n\n\n\nDosing in Adult Patients with Renal Impairment\n\n\n\nDose adjustment of oseltamivir is recommended for patients with creatinine clearance between 10 and 60 mL/min and patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) undergoing hemodialysis or continuous peritoneal dialysis receiving oseltamivir for the treatment or chemoprophylaxis of influenza. Oseltamivir is not recommended for patients with ESRD not undergoing dialysis. The recommended doses are detailed in Table 3; duration of treatment and chemoprophylaxis is the same as recommended for patients with normal renal function. The dose of intravenous peramivir should be reduced for patients with baseline creatinine clearance below 50 mL/min (see Table 3).\nNo dose adjustment is recommended for inhaled zanamivir for a 5-day course of treatment for patients with renal impairment. Pharmacokinetic analysis did not identify a clinically meaningful effect of renal function on the pharmacokinetics of baloxavir in patients with creatinine clearance 50 mL/min and above. The effects of severe renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of baloxavir marboxil or its active metabolite, baloxavir, have not been evaluated.\n\n\n\nTable 3.

Avoid co-administration of baloxavir with polyvalent cation-containing laxatives, antacids, or oral supplements (e.g., calcium, iron, magnesium, selenium, or zinc).\nConcurrent administration of antiviral drugs with intranasal live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) may inhibit viral replication of LAIV and thereby decrease the effectiveness of LAIV vaccination. LAIV should not be given if oseltamivir or zanamivir was administered within 48 hours of planned vaccination, or if peramivir was administered within 5 days of planned vaccination, or if baloxavir was administered within 17 days of planned vaccination. If LAIV is given, and antiviral medications are subsequently administered up to two weeks after vaccination, the effectiveness of LAIV might be reduced, and persons who receive these antiviral medications within two weeks after receiving LAIV should be revaccinated with another appropriate influenza vaccine (e.g., IIV or RIV4).\n\nFor more information, visit the\u00a0Seasonal Influenza (Flu)\u00a0site, email\u00a0CDC-INFO, or call CDC at 800-CDC-INFO (English and Spanish) or 888-232-6348 (TTY).\n\nTop of PageResourcesDiagnostic Testing for InfluenzaMore information for clinicians on influenza diagnostic testing is available.\nMoreInformation on Influenza ActivityClinicians should contact their local or state health department for information about current local influenza activity.\u00a0CDC\u2019s FluView report gives Information regarding national influenza activity weekly during influenza season.\nMoreReferencesA more complete list of influenza antiviral references is available.\nMore", "reports": [{"diseases": ["sars", "COVID-19"], "syndromes": ["Influenza-like illness"], "event_date": "2009-03-23 00:00:00", "locations": [null, 6255150, 3426543, 11139890, 4634482, 6251796, 1637624, 2759197]}]}{"url": "https://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/diagnosis/table-flu-covid19-detection.html", "date_of_publication": "", "headline": "Table 4.

The composition of U.S. flu vaccines is reviewed annually and updated as needed to match circulating flu viruses. Flu vaccines protect against the three or four viruses (depending on the vaccine) that research suggests will be most common.\nFor 2020-2021, trivalent (three-component) egg-based vaccines are recommended to contain:\n\nA/Guangdong-Maonan/SWL1536/2019 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus (updated)\nA/Hong Kong/2671/2019 (H3N2)-like virus (updated)\nB/Washington/02/2019 (B/Victoria lineage)-like virus (updated)\n\nQuadrivalent (four-component) egg-based vaccines, which protect against a second lineage of B viruses, are recommended to contain:\n\nthe three recommended viruses above, plus B/Phuket/3073/2013-like (Yamagata lineage) virus.\n\nFor 2020-2021, cell- or recombinant-based vaccines are recommended to contain:\n\nA/Hawaii/70/2019 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus (updated)\nA/Hong Kong/45/2019 (H3N2)-like virus (updated)\nB/Washington/02/2019 (B/Victoria lineage)-like virus (updated)\nB/Phuket/3073/2013-like (Yamagata lineage) virus\n\n Are there any changes to the 2020-2021 Northern Hemisphere vaccines from what was included in this season\u2019s 2019-2020 U.S. flu vaccines?Yes, this season\u2019s flu vaccines were updated to better match viruses expected to be circulating in the United States.\n\nThe egg-based H1N1 vaccine component was updated from an A/Brisbane/02/2018 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus to an A/Guangdong-Maonan/SWL1536/2019 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus.\nThe cell- or recombinant-based H1N1 vaccine component was updated from an A/Brisbane/02/2018 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus to an A/Hawaii/70/2019 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus.\nThe egg-based H3N2 vaccine component was updated from an A/Kansas/14/2017 (H3N2)-like virus to an A/Hong Kong/2671/2019 (H3N2)-like virus.\nThe cell- or recombinant-based H3N2 vaccine component was updated from an A/Kansas/14/2017 (H3N2)-like virus to an A/Hong Kong/45/2019 (H3N2)-like virus.\nThe B/Victoria lineage vaccine component was updated from a B/Colorado/06/2017 (B/Victoria lineage)-like virus to a B/Washington/02/2019 (B/Victoria lineage)-like virus.\nThe B/Yamagata lineage vaccine component was not updated.\n\nAre there any new vaccines licensed for use during the 2020-2021 flu season?\nThere are two new vaccines licensed for use during the 2020-2021 flu season.\n\nThe first is a quadrivalent high-dose vaccine licensed for use in adults 65 years and older. This vaccine will replace the previously licensed trivalent high-dose vaccine.\n\nThe second new vaccine that will be available is a quadrivalent adjuvanted vaccine licensed for use in adults 65 years and older.\n\nThis vaccine is similar to the previously licensed trivalent vaccine containing MF59 adjuvant, but it has one additional influenza B component.\n\nMore information about new vaccines available this year. What flu vaccines are recommended this season?For the 2020-2021 flu season, providers may choose to administer any licensed, age-appropriate flu vaccine (IIV, RIV4, or LAIV4) with no preference for any one vaccine over another.\nVaccine options this season include:\n\nStandard dose flu shots.\nHigh-dose shots for people 65 years and older.\nShots made with adjuvant for people 65 years and older.\nShots made with virus grown in cell culture. No eggs are involved in the production of this vaccine.\nShots made using a vaccine production technology (recombinant vaccine) that do not require having a candidate vaccine virus (CVV) sample to produce.\nLive attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV). \u2013 A vaccine made with attenuated (weakened) live virus that is given by nasal spray.\n\n Do we need to get a flu vaccine earlier this year (i.e. July/August)?There is no change in CDC\u2019s recommendation on timing of vaccination this flu season. Getting vaccinated in July or August is too early, especially for older people, because of the likelihood of reduced protection against flu infection later in the flu season. September and October are good times to get vaccinated. However, as long as flu viruses are circulating, vaccination should continue, even in January or later.\nMore information for vaccination timing this year. Will there be changes in how and where flu vaccine is given this fall and winter?How and where people get a flu vaccine may need to change due to the COVID-19 pandemic. CDC works with healthcare providers and state and local health departments to develop contingency plans on how to vaccinate people against flu without increasing their risk of exposure to respiratory germs, like the virus that causes COVID-19, and has released Interim Guidance for Immunization Services During the COVID-19 Pandemic. More information is available in the \u2018Administering Flu Vaccines during the COVID-19 Pandemic\u2019 section below.\nSome settings that usually provide flu vaccine, like workplaces, may not offer vaccination this upcoming season, because of the challenges with maintaining social distancing. For more information on where you can get a flu vaccine, visit\u00a0www.vaccinefinder.orgexternal iconexternal icon. Information on getting a flu vaccine safely this season is available in the \u2018Getting a Flu Vaccine during the COVID-19 Pandemic\u2019 section below. How many flu vaccines are expected to be available for the 2020-2021 flu season?Flu vaccine is produced by private manufacturers, so supply depends on manufacturers. For the 2020-2021 season, manufacturers have projected they will provide as many as 194-198 million doses of flu vaccine, which is more than the 175 million dose record set during the 2019-2020 flu season. Are there delays in the availability of flu vaccine?Currently, influenza vaccine manufacturers are not reporting any significant delays in national flu vaccine supply or distribution this season.\nInfluenza vaccine production and distribution in the US are primarily private sector endeavors. CDC encourages manufacturers and distributors to use a distribution strategy in which providers receive smaller shipments to allow as many providers as possible to begin vaccination activities early in the vaccination season. Ideally, the intervals between shipments are short so that each provider has a continuous supply and can continue vaccinating patients without interruption. While no significant delays have been reported, in some places, robust demand for vaccine and supplies required to support flu vaccination efforts, like needles or syringes, may mean that some providers run out of vaccine or other supplies before their next shipment has arrived. While an allocation system can initially limit the size of individual orders, as supplies become available in increasing numbers, supply is expected to catch up with demand. Additionally, because vaccine manufacturing has been extended to support the production of a record number of flu vaccine doses this year, providers are likely to receive more shipments throughout the season.\nTo make sure your provider has flu vaccine available, call ahead to confirm availability. There also may be other locations in your area that have vaccine available. Use the VaccineFinderexternal icon to find out where to get vaccinated near you.\nCDC will continue to provide weekly updates on total flu vaccine doses distributed throughout the 2020-2021 flu season. Are there enough doses of flu vaccine available for the 2020-2021 flu season?Vaccine manufactures have said that they will produce between 194 and 198 million doses of flu vaccine this season. While this isn\u2019t enough for every person in the U.S. to receive a flu vaccine this season, not everyone chooses to get vaccinated. For example, last season, only about half of Americans chose to get a flu vaccine and, in general, there are many doses of flu vaccine that go unused every season.\nThat said, demand for flu vaccine may be greater this season because of the COVID-19 pandemic. And while it would be unusual, it is possible that all flu vaccines will be used this season. CDC\u2019s goal is for every available dose of flu vaccine to be used to protect people from flu. To make sure your provider has flu vaccine available, call ahead. There also may be other locations in your area that have vaccine available. Use the VaccineFinderexternal icon to find out where to get vaccinated near you.\nCDC will continue to provide weekly updates on total flu vaccine doses distributed throughout the 2020-2021 flu season. What should someone 65 or older do who is having trouble finding high-dose flu vaccine?CDC does not have a preferential recommendation for any flu vaccine over another, and vaccination should not be delayed to wait on a specific vaccine product when another vaccine licensed for use in adults is available.\nThere are several flu vaccine formulations that are approved for use in people 65 and older, including two so-called \u201cenhanced\u201d flu vaccines: the high dose flu vaccine and the adjuvanted flu vaccine. Both vaccines are specifically designed to create a stronger immune response in people aged 65 years and older.\nAnother recent studyexternal icon showed that a vaccine made using recombinant technology can also produce a stronger immune response in adults 65 years and older.\nFor those having trouble locating \u201cenhanced\u201d vaccines licensed for use in people 65 years and older, call providers ahead of time to check availability. There also may be other locations in your area that have vaccine available. Use VaccineFinderexternal icon to find out where to get vaccinated near you.\nHow to locate high-dose and adjuvanted flu vaccine using VaccineFinder:\n\nVisit VaccineFinder.orgexternal icon\nClick \u201cFind Vaccines\u201d\nClick \u201cSelect your vaccines\u201d\nSelect \u201cFlu Shot (65+)\u201d and then click \u201cAdd 1 Vaccine\u201d\nEnter your address or zip code\nClick \u201cSearch For Vaccine\u201d\nChoose a vaccine provider from the list that appears or choose an option from the map.\nCall ahead to confirm availability and then get your flu vaccine from your chosen provider.\n\n What if my vaccine provider doesn't have my preferred flu vaccine?CDC recommends use of any licensed, age-appropriate influenza vaccine during the 2020-2021 influenza season, including inactivated influenza vaccine, high-dose influenza vaccine, adjuvanted influenza vaccine, or recombinant flu vaccine.\nVaccination should not be delayed to wait on a specific vaccine product when another age-appropriate vaccine is available. What should vaccine providers do if they are experiencing problems with purchasing needles for flu vaccination?No widespread needle shortages or supply interruptions have been reported. Adequate supplies are expected to be available to support both the 2020\u20132021 influenza vaccination program and routine vaccination efforts. However, due to high demand for influenza vaccination in some locations, there may be some limited or temporarily unavailable supplies of specific types of needles and needle/syringe sets. CDC has developed a resource guide\u00a0for providers who are experiencing problems with purchasing needles for influenza and routine vaccinations. Flu and COVID-19What is the difference between Influenza (Flu) and COVID-19?Influenza (Flu) and COVID-19 are both contagious respiratory illnesses, but they are caused by different viruses. COVID-19 is caused by infection with a new coronavirus (called SARS-CoV-2) and flu is caused by infection with\u00a0influenza viruses. Because some of the symptoms of flu and COVID-19 are similar, it may be hard to tell the difference between them based on symptoms alone, and testing may be needed to help confirm a diagnosis.\nCOVID-19 seems to spread more easily than flu and causes more serious illnesses in some people. It can also take longer before people show symptoms and people can be contagious for longer.\nWhile more is learned every day, there is still a lot that is unknown about COVID-19 and the virus that causes it. This page\u00a0compares COVID-19 and flu, given the best available information to date.\nTo learn more about COVID-19, visit Coronavirus (COVID-19).\nTo learn more about flu, visit Influenza (Flu). Will there be flu along with COVID-19 in the fall and winter?While it\u2019s not possible to say with certainty what will happen in the fall and winter, CDC believes it\u2019s likely that flu viruses and the virus that causes COVID-19 will both be spreading. In this context, getting a flu vaccine will be more important than ever. CDC recommends that all people 6 months and older get a yearly flu vaccine. Can I have flu and COVID-19 at the same time?Yes. It is possible have flu, as well as other respiratory illnesses, and COVID-19 at the same time. Health experts are still studying how common this can be.\nSome of the symptoms of flu and COVID-19 are similar, making it hard to tell the difference between them based on symptoms alone. Diagnostic testing\u00a0can help determine if you are sick with flu or COVID-19. Is there a test that can detect both flu and COVID-19?Yes. CDC has developed a test that will check for A and B type seasonal flu viruses and SARS CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. This test will be used by U.S. public health laboratories. Testing for these viruses at the same time will give public health officials important information about how flu and COVID-19 are spreading and what prevention steps should be taken. The test will also help public health laboratories save time and testing materials, and to possibly return test results faster.\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has given CDC an Emergency Use Authorizationexternal iconexternal icon\u00a0for this new test. Initial test kits were sent to public health laboratories in early August 2020. CDC will continue to manufacture and distribute these kits.\nMore information for laboratories is available. Will the new test that detects both flu and COVID-19 replace other tests?No. This new test is designed for use at CDC-supported public health laboratories at state and local levels, where it will supplement and streamline surveillance for flu and COVID-19. The use of this specialized test will be focused on public health surveillance efforts and will not replace any COVID-19 tests currently used in commercial laboratories, hospitals, clinics, and other healthcare settings.\nCDC\u2019s first viral test for SARS-CoV-2 (the CDC 2019-nCoV Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel (ER-34)) will still be available for qualified laboratories to order through the International Reagent Resource (IRR)external iconexternal icon. The new multiplex assay\u00a0can also be ordered through the IRR. Check the IRR website for details.\nFor additional questions, please visit: Clinical Questions about COVID-19: Questions and Answers: Testing, Diagnosis, and Notification Is COVID-19 more dangerous than flu?Flu and COVID-19 can both result in serious illness, including illness resulting in hospitalization or death. While there is still much to learn about COVID-19, recent studies show it does seem as if COVID-19 is more deadly than seasonal influenza. Will a flu vaccine protect me against COVID-19?Getting a flu vaccine will not protect against COVID-19, however flu vaccination has many other important benefits. Flu vaccines have been shown to reduce the risk of flu illness, hospitalization and death. Getting a flu vaccine this fall will be more important than ever, not only to reduce your risk from flu but also to help conserve potentially scarce health care resources. Does a flu vaccination increase your risk of getting COVID-19?There is no evidence that getting a flu vaccination increases your risk of getting sick from a coronavirus, like the one that causes COVID-19.\nYou may have heard about a studyexternal iconexternal icon\u00a0published in January 2020 that reported an association between flu vaccination and risk of four commonly circulating seasonal coronaviruses, but not the one that causes COVID-19. This report was later found to be incorrect.\nThe results from that initial study led researchers in Canada to look at their data to see if they could find similar results in their population. The results from Canada\u2019s studyexternal iconexternal icon\u00a0showed that flu vaccination did not increase risk for these seasonal coronaviruses. The Canadian findings highlighted the protective benefits of flu vaccination.\nThe Canadian researchers also identified a flaw in the methods of the first study, noting that it violated the part of study design that compares vaccination rates among patients with and without flu (test negative design). This flaw led to the incorrect association between flu vaccination and seasonal coronavirus risk. When these researchers reexamined data from the first study using correct methods, they found that flu vaccination did not increase risk for infection with other respiratory viruses, including seasonal coronaviruses. What is CDC doing to promote flu vaccination during the COVID-19 pandemic?To address the importance of influenza vaccination, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, CDC will maximize flu vaccination by increasing availability of vaccine, including purchasing an additional 2 million doses of pediatric flu vaccine and 9.3 million doses of adult flu vaccine, by emphasizing the importance of flu vaccination for the entire flu season, and by conducting targeted communication outreach to specific groups who are at higher risk for complications from flu. These same groups are often at higher risk for COVID-19 too, so protecting them from influenza is important to decrease their risk of co-infection. Communication strategies for providers and the public will include:\n\nEducational outreach activities by CDC, including social media, press conferences, web page spotlights, radio media tours, op-eds, and other publications,\nA digital campaign to educate the general public and people with who are at increased risk from influenza and COVID-19 complications,\nSpecial educational efforts to inform the general population, people with underlying health conditions, and African American and Hispanic audiences about the importance of flu vaccination, and\nUpdated vaccination websites for the public and providers that highlight the safety precautions being implemented in healthcare facilities during the pandemic.\n\n If I get sick with flu, am I at higher risk of contracting COVID-19?Because COVID-19 is still a relatively new illness, there is little data on how flu illness affects the risk of getting COVID-19. In general, getting sick with one virus, like flu, doesn\u2019t affect being infected with another, like the virus that causes COVID-19. \u00a0We do know that people can be infected with flu viruses and the virus that causes COVID-19 at the same time. Getting a flu vaccine can reduce your risk of getting flu. Because the symptoms of flu and COVID-19 are similar, how will I know if I have flu or COVID-19?Although there are some differences between flu and COVID-19, they also share signs and symptoms. For this reason, it may be hard to tell the difference between them based on symptoms alone. Testing may be needed to help confirm a diagnosis. Get more information on symptoms of COVID-19 and flu. I think I may have flu. Is it safe for me to visit my health care provider during the COVID-19 pandemic?Providers may have different procedures and practices for evaluating and treating flu during the COVID-19 pandemic. If you have flu symptoms and are at high risk of serious flu complications, you should call your health care provider as soon as possible to tell them about your symptoms. Your provider may decide to treat you with flu antiviral medications. Follow your health care provider\u2019s and CDC\u2019s recommendations for doctor visits. Continue to take everyday preventive actions. Getting a Flu Vaccine during the COVID-19 PandemicIf coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is spreading in my community, should I still go out to get a flu vaccine?Yes. Getting a flu vaccine is an essential part of protecting your health and your family\u2019s health this season. To protect your health when getting a flu vaccine, follow CDC\u2019s recommendations for running essential errands and doctor visits. Continue to take everyday preventive actions. How can I safely get a flu vaccine if COVID-19 is spreading in my community?When going to get a flu vaccine, practice everyday preventive actions and follow CDC recommendations for running essential errands.\nAsk your doctor, pharmacist, or health department if they are following CDC\u2019s vaccination pandemic guidance. Any vaccination location following CDC\u2019s guidance should be a safe place for you to get a flu vaccine. If I am at high risk for serious illness from COVID-19 or flu, where is the safest place for me to get a flu vaccine?You can safely get a flu vaccine at multiple locations including your doctor\u2019s office, health departments, and pharmacies. You can use\u00a0VaccineFinder.orgexternal iconexternal icon\u00a0to find where flu vaccines are available near you. When going to get a flu vaccine, be sure to practice everyday preventive actions.\nAsk your doctor, pharmacist, or health department if they are following CDC\u2019s vaccination pandemic guidance. Any vaccination location following CDC\u2019s guidance should be a safe place for you to get a flu vaccine.\n\n\nVaccination of people at high risk\u00a0for flu complications is especially important to decrease their risk of severe flu illness. Many people at higher risk from flu also seem to be at higher risk from COVID-19. If you are at high risk, it is especially important for you to get a flu vaccine this year.\n\n\n Why do I need a flu vaccine if I am wearing a mask and social distancing?Wearing a mask and social distancing can help protect you and others from respiratory viruses, like flu and COVID-19, but best way to prevent flu illness is for everyone 6 months and older to be vaccinated each year. Flu activity is low in my community right now; should I wait to get a flu vaccine?No, you should not delay getting a flu vaccine. While flu activity may be low in your community now, it could begin increasing at any time. Remember, it takes about two weeks after vaccination to develop antibodies that provide protection against flu. Ideally, you should get vaccinated before flu viruses begin circulating in your community. Everyone 6 months and older should get a flu vaccine each year. Can I get a flu vaccine if I have COVID-19 or if I think I have been exposed to someone with COVID-19?For people who are sick with COVID-19 and who are already in a medical setting (for example, are in a hospital or other health care setting), flu vaccination should be deferred until they are no longer acutely ill.\n\u00a0For those who are sick with COVID-19 or think they might have COVID-19, it is important to stay home and stay away from other people, unless medical care is required. Those who are not in a medical care setting (for example, are isolating at home), should wait until they meet criteria for leaving isolation (even if they have no symptoms) to come to a vaccination setting in order to avoid spreading COVID-19 to others in the vaccination setting. CDC has guidance for when you can be around others after having COVID-19. Are there special precautions my doctor, pharmacist, or health department should take this flu season to make sure flu vaccines can be given safely during the COVID-19 pandemic?Yes. CDC has resources to help with vaccine planning during the COVID-19 pandemic. Ask your doctor, pharmacist, or health department if they are following CDC\u2019s vaccination pandemic guidance. \u00a0And protect yourself by practicing everyday preventive actions. I don\u2019t have a primary care provider, where can I get a flu vaccine?If you don\u2019t have a doctor that you regularly see, flu vaccines are also available at locations including health departments and pharmacies. You can use\u00a0VaccineFinder.orgexternal iconexternal icon\u00a0to find where flu vaccines are available near you. Can I get a COVID-19 vaccine and flu vaccine at the same time?No. You should not get a COVID-19 vaccine and a flu vaccine at the same time. COVID-19 vaccines should be given alone with at least 14 days either before or after you get any other vaccines, including a flu vaccine. This is because there is currently limited information on the safety and effectiveness of getting other vaccines at the same time as a COVID-19 vaccine.\nAs more information becomes available, this recommendation may change. Your healthcare provider can help you decide the best vaccination schedule for you and your family. Flu ActivityWill new flu viruses circulate this season?Flu viruses are constantly changing so it\u2019s not unusual for new flu viruses to appear each year. More information about how flu viruses change\u00a0is available. When will flu activity begin and when will it peak?The timing of flu is difficult to predict and can vary in different parts of the country and from season to season. Are there any updates in the methods for flu surveillance for the upcoming season?For the 2020-2021 flu season, there are some changes to FluView surveillance methodology.\nThis season, in addition to state-level data, the influenza-like-illness (ILI) activity map will display ILI activity by Core-based Statistical Areas (CBSA), a U.S. geographic area defined by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) that consists of one or more counties (or equivalents) anchored by an urban center of at least 10,000 people plus adjacent counties that are socioeconomically tied to the urban center by commuting.\nAlso, during most flu seasons, state and territorial health departments report the level of geographic spread of flu activity in their jurisdictions each week through the\u00a0State and Territorial Epidemiologists Report. However, due to the impact of COVID-19 on ILI surveillance, and the facts that the state and territorial epidemiologists report relies heavily on ILI activity, reporting for this system will be suspended for the 2020-21 influenza season.\nFinally, NCHS collects death certificate data for all deaths occurring in the United States, and these data are aggregated by the week of death occurrence. In previous flu seasons, the NCHS surveillance data were used to calculate the percent of all deaths occurring each week that had pneumonia and/or influenza (P&I) listed as a cause of death. Because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, COVID-19 coded deaths were added to P&I to create the PIC (pneumonia, influenza, and/or COVID-19) classification. PIC includes all deaths with pneumonia, influenza, and/or COVID-19 listed on the death certificate.\nMore information on flu surveillance methodology and these updates is available online. Flu Vaccine CoverageWhat vaccine uptake estimates will CDC provide this season?CDC has developed a new Weekly National Influenza Vaccination Dashboard designed to share preliminary, in-season, weekly influenza vaccination coverage estimates and related data.\nThe dashboard will include information on the number of influenza vaccine doses distributed in the United States, weekly flu vaccination coverage rates for children 6 months \u2013 17 years old, monthly flu vaccination coverage rates among pregnant persons, and information on how many flu vaccines have been administered in pharmacies and doctor\u2019s offices.\nThe data will be updated weekly or monthly, depending on the data source, throughout the 2020-2021 influenza season; other data sources will be added as they become available. Visit the National Influenza Vaccination Dashboard for more information.\n\u00a0\nCDC also provides seasonal flu vaccination coverage estimates at the end of a flu season. However, those estimates are not usually available until several months after the flu season ends. How is CDC tracking weekly flu vaccination coverage among children 6 months \u2013 17 years old?Influenza vaccination coverage among children is assessed through the\u00a0National Immunization Survey-Flu\u00a0(NIS-Flu), which provides weekly influenza vaccination coverage estimates for children 6 months\u201317 years old. NIS-Flu is a national random-digit-dialed cellular telephone survey of households conducted during the flu season (October-June). Additional information about NIS-Flu methods and estimates from 2019-2020 season are available at FluVaxView. How is CDC tracking monthly flu vaccination coverage among pregnant women?Monthly flu vaccination coverage estimates among pregnant women are based on electronic health record (EHR) data from the\u00a0Vaccine Safety Datalink\u00a0(VSD), a collaboration between CDC\u2019s Immunization Safety Office and nine integrated health care organizations. Of note, because these estimates are based on data from nine integrated health care systems, they may not be representative of all pregnant women in the U.S. How is CDC tracking the number of flu vaccines administered at pharmacies and doctor\u2019s offices?CDC is tracking the number of flu vaccines administered at pharmacies and doctor\u2019s offices by utilizing new sources of vaccination data, including IQVIAexternal icon\u00a0data for vaccinations administered in retail pharmacies (e.g., \u00a0chain, mass merchandise, food stores, and independent pharmacies) and doctor\u2019s offices. When will the first flu vaccine uptake estimates be provided for this season?CDC will launch the first weekly FluVaxView dashboard in December. The number of flu vaccine doses distributed, vaccination coverage estimates for children, and vaccinations administered in retail pharmacies and doctor\u2019s offices will be updated weekly. Coverage estimates for pregnant women will be updated monthly. Visit the National Influenza Vaccination Dashboard for more information. Is this the same kind of vaccine uptake information that has been provided in the past?Each flu season since 2009-2010, CDC has estimated annual influenza vaccination coverage for the United States by utilizing data from several nationally representative surveys: the\u00a0Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System\u00a0(BRFSS), the\u00a0National Health Interview Survey\u00a0(NHIS), and the\u00a0National Immunization Survey-Flu (NIS-Flu). Internet panel surveys of\u00a0adults,\u00a0health care personnel, and\u00a0pregnant women\u00a0are also used.\nClick here for vaccination coverage estimates from past flu season. CDC will continue to provide end of season estimates of influenza vaccination coverage from these data sources.\n\u00a0\nFor the 2020-21 flu season, CDC will provide weekly updates on the number of flu vaccine doses distributed, vaccination coverage estimates for children, and the number of doses administered in pharmacies and doctor\u2019s offices. Coverage estimates for pregnant women and will be updated monthly. Is CDC working to improve influenza vaccine uptake data?CDC is exploring non-survey data sources, such as claims and other administrative data, to track flu vaccination coverage. \u00a0For example, CDC is exploring ways to estimate within-season influenza vaccination coverage among adults using data on the number of doses administered in pharmacies and doctor\u2019s offices and estimates of the proportion of all influenza vaccinations that are received in these settings.\u00a0 CDC supports state and local jurisdictions in use of their immunization information systems to assess influenza vaccination coverage at the jurisdictional level. Administering Flu Vaccines During the COVID-19 PandemicIs there guidance for safely administering vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic?CDC has released Interim Guidance for Immunization Services During the COVID-19 Pandemic. This guidance is intended to help immunization providers in a variety of clinical and alternative settings with the safe administration of vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic. This guidance will be continually reassessed and updated based on the evolving epidemiology of COVID-19 in the United States. Healthcare providers who give vaccines should also consult guidance from state, local, tribal, and territorial health officials.\nFor the complete interim guidance for immunization services during the COVID-19 pandemic. Why is it important for influenza (flu) vaccines to be given during the COVID-19 pandemic?Efforts to reduce the spread of COVID-19, such as stay-at-home and shelter-in-place orders, have led to decreased use of routine preventive medical services, including immunization services. Ensuring that people continue or start getting routine vaccinations during the COVID-19 pandemic is essential for protecting people and communities from vaccine-preventable diseases and outbreaks, including flu. Routine vaccination prevents illnesses that lead to unnecessary medical visits and hospitalizations, which further strain the healthcare system.\nFor the upcoming flu season, flu vaccination will be very important to reduce flu because it can help reduce the overall impact of respiratory illnesses on the population and thus lessen the resulting burden on the healthcare system during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nA flu vaccine may also provide several individual health benefits, including keeping you from getting sick with flu, reducing the severity of your illness if you do get flu and reducing your risk of a flu-associated hospitalization. Who should get their flu vaccine during the COVID-19 pandemic?Annual flu vaccination is recommended\u00a0for everyone 6 months of age and older, with rare exceptions, because it is an effective way to decrease flu illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, reducing the overall burden of respiratory illnesses is important to protect vulnerable populations at risk for severe illness, the healthcare system, and other critical infrastructure. Thus, healthcare providers should use every opportunity during the influenza vaccination season to administer influenza vaccines to all eligible persons, including;\n\nEssential workers: Including healthcare personnel (including nursing home, long-term care facility, and pharmacy staff) and other critical infrastructure\u00a0workforce\nPersons at increased risk for\u00a0severe illness from COVID-19: Including adults aged 65 years and older, residents in a nursing home or long-term care facility, and persons of all ages with certain underlying medical conditions. Severe illness from COVID-19 has been observed to disproportionately affect members of certain racial/ethnic minority groups\nPersons at increased risk for serious influenza complications: Including infants and young children, children with neurologic conditions, pregnant women, adults aged 65 years and older, and other persons with certain underlying medical conditions\n\n Should a flu vaccine be given to someone with suspected or confirmed COVID-19?No. Vaccination should be deferred (postponed) for people with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, regardless of whether they have symptoms, until they have met the criteria\u00a0to discontinue their isolation. While mild illness is not a contraindication to flu vaccination, vaccination visits for these people should be postponed to avoid exposing healthcare personnel and other patients to the virus that causes COVID-19. When scheduling or confirming appointments for vaccination, patients should be instructed to notify the provider\u2019s office or clinic in advance if they currently have or develop any symptoms of COVID-19.\nAdditionally, a prior infection with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 or flu does not protect someone from future flu infections. The best way to prevent seasonal flu is to get vaccinated every year. What steps can healthcare personnel take to safely give flu vaccine during the COVID-19 pandemic?The potential for asymptomatic spread of the virus that causes COVID-19 underscores the importance of applying infection prevention practices to encounters with all patients, including physical distancing (at least 6 feet) when possible, respiratory and hand hygiene, surface decontamination, and source control while in a healthcare facility. Immunization providers should refer to the guidance developed to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in healthcare settings, including outpatient and ambulatory care settings.\nTo help ensure the safe delivery of care during vaccination visits, providers should:\n\nMinimize chances for exposures, including steps such as these:\n\nScreen patients for symptoms of COVID-19 and contact with persons with possible COVID-19 prior to\u00a0and upon their arrival at the facility, and isolate symptomatic patients as soon as possible.\nLimit and monitor points of entry to the facility and install barriers, such as clear plastic sneeze guards, to limit physical contact with patients at triage.\nImplement policies for adults and children over the age of 2 years to wear cloth face coverings\u00a0(if tolerated).\nEnsure patients practice respiratory hygiene, cough etiquette, and hand hygiene.\n\n\nEnsure all staff adhere to the following infection prevention and control procedures:\n\nFollow Standard Precautions, which include guidance for hand hygiene and cleaning the environment between patients.\nWear a medical facemask at all times.\nUse eye protection based on level of community transmission\u00a0of the virus that causes COVID-19:\n\nModerate-to-substantial transmission: Healthcare providers should wear eye protection given the increased likelihood of encountering asymptomatic COVID-19 patients.\nMinimal-to-no transmission: Universal eye protection is considered optional, unless otherwise indicated as a part of Standard Precautions.\n\n\n\n\nConsider these additional steps during vaccine administration:\n\nIntranasal or oral vaccines:\n\nHealthcare providers should wear gloves when giving intranasal or oral vaccines because of the increased likelihood of coming into contact with a patient\u2019s mucous membranes and body fluids. They should change their gloves and wash their hands between patients.\nGiving these vaccines is not considered an aerosol-generating procedure\u00a0and thus, the use of an N95 or higher-level respirator is not recommended.\n\n\nIntramuscular or subcutaneous vaccines:\n\nIf healthcare providers wear gloves when administering vaccine, they should change their gloves and wash their hands between patients.\n\n\n\n\nFor patients (sick or well) presenting for care or routine visits, ensure physical distancing by implementing strategies, such as:\n\nSeparating sick from well patients by scheduling these visits during different times of the day (e.g., well visits in the morning and sick visits in the afternoon), placing patients with sick visits in different areas of the facility, or scheduling patients with sick visits in a different location from well visits (when space is available).\nReduce crowding in waiting areas by asking patients to remain outside (e.g., stay in their vehicles, if applicable) until they are called into the facility for their appointment.\nEnsure that physical distancing measures, with separation of at least 6 feet between patients and visitors, are maintained during all aspects of the visit, including check-in, checkout, screening procedures, and postvaccination monitoring. Use strategies such as physical barriers, signs, ropes, and floor markings.\nUse electronic communications as much as possible (e.g., filling out needed paperwork online in advance) to minimize patients\u2019 time in the office as well as their sharing of materials (e.g., clipboards, pens).\n\n\n\n Is there guidance for giving flu vaccine in settings other than a doctor\u2019s office (e.g., pharmacies; temporary, off-site, or satellite clinics; and large-scale influenza clinics)?Yes. Guidance has been developed for giving vaccines at pharmacies, temporary, off-site, or satellite clinicspdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon, and large-scale influenza clinics. Other approaches to vaccination during the COVID-19 pandemic may include drive-through immunization services at fixed sites, curbside clinics, mobile outreach units, and home visits.\nThe general principles outlined for healthcare facilities\u00a0should also be applied to alternative vaccination sites, with additional precautions for physical distancing that are particularly relevant for large-scale clinics, such as:\n\nProviding specific appointment times or other strategies to manage patient flow and avoid crowding.\nEnsuring sufficient staff and resources to help move patients through the clinic as quickly as possible.\nLimiting the overall number of patients at any given time, particularly for populations at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.\nSetting up a one-way flow through the site and using signs, ropes, or other measures to direct patient traffic and ensure physical distancing between patients.\nArranging a separate vaccination area or separate hours for persons at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19, such as older adults and persons with underlying medical conditions, when feasible.\nSelecting a space large enough to ensure a minimum distance of 6 feet between patients in line or in waiting areas for vaccination, between vaccination stations, and in postvaccination monitoring areas (the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends that providers consider observing patients for 15 minutes after vaccinationpdf iconpdf icon\u00a0to decrease the risk for injury should they faint).\n\n When can someone who recovered from COVID-19 receive an influenza vaccine?Influenza vaccination should be deferred until a patient is no longer acutely ill. This may be different for patients who are already being cared for in a medical setting than it is for patients who are isolating at home. In a medical setting, the timing for vaccination is a matter of clinical discretion. In the outpatient setting, in general, patients who are isolating at home should wait until they meet criteria for leaving isolation (even if they have no symptoms) to come to a vaccination setting in order to avoid spreading COVID-19 to others in the vaccination setting. CDC has guidance for when you can be around others after having COVID-19. What is CDC\u2019s recommendation regarding drive-through influenza vaccination clinics?Curbside and drive-through vaccination clinics may provide the best option for staff and patient safety during the COVID-19 pandemic. Read CDC\u2019s guidance on drive-through vaccination clinics. Should we test for COVID-19 or perform COVID-19 screening before giving an influenza vaccine?COVID-19 testing prior to administering an influenza vaccine is not necessary. However, people who are sick and are suspected of having COVID-19 but who are not already in a health care facility should not come to a vaccination clinic or a healthcare facility for an influenza vaccination, in order to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 to others. Expanded guidance for influenza vaccination during the COVID-19 pandemic is available online: Additional Considerations for Influenza Vaccination of Persons in Healthcare Facilities and Congregate Settings During the COVID-19 Pandemic. Can COVID-19 and influenza vaccines be co-administered?No. The COVID-19 vaccines should be administered alone, with a minimum interval of 14 days before or after administration of any other vaccines, including influenza vaccines. This is because of a lack of data on safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccine administered simultaneously with other vaccines. If COVID-19 vaccine is inadvertently administered within 14 days of another vaccine, doses do not need to be repeated for either vaccine.\nThis recommendation may be updated as more safety and efficacy data become available. Testing and Treatment of Respiratory Illness when SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza Viruses are Co-circulatingWhat should we do if we have a patient who is sick with influenza/COVID-19-like symptoms while waiting for diagnostic test results?While waiting on results of testing, sick non-hospitalized persons with respiratory symptoms should self-isolate at home. Even if people test negative for both viruses, they should self-isolate because of the potential for false negative testing results \u2013 depending upon what kind of test was done (antigen test, molecular test) and the level of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza transmission\u00a0 in the community. Persons not hospitalized but who are at high-risk for complications from influenza should get antiviral treatment for influenza as soon as possible.\nFor hospitalized patients, empiric oseltamivir treatment for suspected influenza should be started as soon as possible regardless of illness duration, without waiting for influenza testing results. Get more information on testing and treatment when SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses are co-circulating. I have a patient who has influenza/COVID-19-like symptoms, how should I proceed with testing and treatment?CDC has developed clinical algorithms that can help guide decisions for influenza testing and treatment when SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses are co-circulating. Do influenza antiviral medications have any positive or negative impact on a concurrent COVID-19 infection?Influenza antiviral medications have no activity against SARS-CoV-2 viruses, nor do they interact with medications used for treatment of COVID-19 patients. If a patient who is at high risk for serious influenza complications is diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus co-infection, they should receive influenza antiviral treatment. Flu Surveillance Data UpdatesWhy was pneumonia, influenza, and COVID-19 (PIC) mortality data added to FluView Interactive?CDC monitors flu deaths each week using death certificate data collected by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). During previous flu seasons, NCHS mortality surveillance data were used to calculate the percentage of all U.S. deaths occurring each week that had pneumonia and/or influenza (P&I) listed as a cause of death on the death certificate. However, because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, COVID-19 coded deaths were added to P&I to create the PIC (pneumonia, influenza and/or COVID-19) mortality classification. CDC has displayed PIC mortality in its FluView report since week 40 of 2020. However, in order to make these data more easily downloadable and interactive, CDC incorporated PIC mortality data into its FluView Interactive data dashboard, beginning with the release of the Week 6 (week ending February 13, 2021) FluView report. FluView Interactive\u00a0is an online data dashboard that accompanies the FluView report. Using FluView Interactive, users can download flu data and view this data via detailed, interactive graphs, charts, maps, and other visualizations.

Heyman Service to America Medal for Science and Environment. The Sammies are presented by the Partnership for Public Service, a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization whose mission is to help make the U.S. government more effective.\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar presented the award to Jernigan, saying, \u201cMost of us try to stay away from people with contagious illnesses, but not Dr. Daniel Jernigan, he goes towards them. During his 25 years with CDC, he\u2019s travelled to investigate SARS in Taiwan and MERS in Saudi Arabia. He\u2019s also worked on avian flu in China and the Ebola outbreak in West Africa.\u201d\nJernigan started at CDC in 1994 as an Epidemic Intelligence Service officer (sometimes called a \u201cDisease Detective\u201d) working in the Respiratory Diseases Branch at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention where early on he was asked to investigate a Legionella outbreak. Since that first investigation 25 years ago, Jernigan has gone on to take leadership roles in CDC\u2019s responses to dozens of contagious disease outbreaks both in the United States and around the world. Today, as Influenza Division Director, Jernigan oversees more than 300 scientists, public health experts, and other staff. At the awards ceremony on October 16, Jernigan recognized his colleagues, saying: \u201cThis award recognizes the work of many people at CDC and in the Influenza Division who are not afraid to jump into complicated situations and develop creative solutions. For flu, those innovations have contributed to averting thousands of deaths and tens of thousands of hospitalizations each year, avoiding illnesses that did not need to occur.\u201d\nNancy Messonnier, MD, Director of CDC\u2019s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said that Jernigan\u2019s \u201cability to manage and lead through any crisis with intelligence and humor and camaraderie\u201d makes his presence valuable in any global health crises.\nAnne Schuchat, MD, CDC\u2019s Principal Deputy Director, commends his ability to innovate.\u00a0 \u201c[Dr. Jernigan] is able to see very far ahead to where we need to go and find innovative ways to get there, whether it\u2019s reinventing how we characterize flu viruses or making laboratories more efficient and ready to surge when there\u2019s a pandemic or bad flu season,\u201d she said.\nBut whether Jernigan is looking to solve a problem in real time, or one that has yet to happen, it\u2019s the fact that he\u2019s able to do so every day that keeps him at CDC.\n\u201cThe ability to effect change very quickly and having the tools to do it is what makes it worth it,\u201d he said. \u201cPlus, I get to work with incredible people as well.\u201d\nLearn more about the work Dr. Jernigan and the Influenza Division are doing by visiting\u00a0www.cdc.gov/flu.\nTo learn more about the Samuel J.

The 2009 H1N1 pandemic was estimated to be associated with 151,700 to 575,400 deaths worldwide during the first year it circulated. [1] This H1N1 virus has continued to circulate seasonally to this day. CDC and its many partners have made great strides in the fields of influenza surveillance, prevention, and treatment since 2009, benefiting both the annual response to seasonal flu epidemics, as well as the global capacity to respond to the next pandemic.

Once labs had the CDC test kit and verified that their testing was running properly, they were able to process their own specimens and no longer needed lab confirmation from CDC.\nGene sequencing technology\n\nDuring the pandemic, owing in part to the preparedness work done prior to 2009, CDC and public health laboratories were able to use molecular testing technology, \u201cwith its pinpoint accuracy and revolutionary speed\u201d [2] to detect cases, and monitor the spread of the virus and its characteristics, including watching for emerging drug resistance, for example. In the wake of the 2009 pandemic, numerous retrospective analyses deemed the use of this technology to be one of the response\u2019s key successes [3].\nSince the pandemic, CDC\u2019s ability to map the complete influenza virus genome has improved exponentially, thanks to considerable leaps forward in gene sequencing technology, sometimes referred to as Next Generation Sequencing or Advanced Molecular Detection (AMD) technology. Where previous technologies revealed the genes of the predominant influenza virus in a respiratory specimen, it\u2019s now possible to see the gene sequences of all of the influenza particles in a single specimen, thereby giving deeper insight into how influenza viruses may change, for example, by mutating inside a single patient to become resistant to antiviral drugs.\nIn 2012 CDC\u2019s influenza laboratory transitioned from a characterization-first approach to a sequence-first approach so now all flu viruses undergo full sequencing as a first step when they arrive at CDC. This change has reduced public health response time to flu outbreaks and also served to greatly expand the global repositories of influenza gene sequence data. Meanwhile, ongoing technological improvements by device manufacturers and CDC\u2019s innovative protocols have brought the gene sequencing cost per virus down from about $180.00 in 2012 to $25.00 per virus in 2019, with additional improvements in the works to bring the cost down even further.\nIn 2009, CDC sequenced influenza virus genomes primarily for the identification of vaccine reference viruses. Now, CDC performs \u201cnext generation sequencing\u201d on close to 7,000 influenza viruses annually, and has submitted more than 30,000 flu virus genomes to public databases.\nTop of PageInfluenza public health laboratory tests\nRT-PCR \n\nSince 2009, the widespread adoption by public health laboratories of the testing technique called \u201creal-time Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction\u201d (rRT-PCR) with CDC\u2019s flu rRT-PCR test kits has directly enhanced the nation\u2019s pandemic preparedness in a number of ways. For one, widespread use of both has led to standardization of influenza testing across the nation\u2019s public health laboratories. Relative to the other diagnostic methods widely used by laboratories to reveal the type and subtype of flu virus in a sample, rRT-PCR produces more-reliable results, and produces those results faster than most other laboratory techniques. [4]\nCDC\u2019s primary rRT-PCR test for influenza viruses (called the \u2018CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel\u2019) is an internationally recognized reference method for detection of influenza. This means the performance of other detection methods is often measured against the performance of CDC\u2019s rRT-PCR flu test.\nThe adaptability of the rRT-PCR test allows laboratories to quickly adjust how specimens are processed in outbreak and pandemic situations to avoid backlogs and unnecessary use of resources. CDC provides algorithms that help to ensure that as more specimens are tested, reagents are conserved, thereby maximizing their public health benefit and further reducing the possibility of supply shortages.\nAlthough laboratories have the option of using other rRT-PCR tests, use of the CDC test in lieu of commercially manufactured rRT-PCR tests takes the pressure off individual laboratories of ensuring their tests are able to detect the newest emerging viruses.\nCDC uses gene sequence data to update its influenza diagnostic kits and reagents, which are used around the world by public health laboratories as the gold-standard for detecting influenza, in large part because of CDC\u2019s rapid response in updating the kits and reagents each time a novel virus emerges.\nFor example, in 2012 the U.S. experienced a rapid up-tick in human infections with swine influenza viruses (called variant virus infections) associated with exposure to infected pigs. CDC quickly confirmed the CDC rRT-PCR test kit\u2019s ability to detect those swine viruses appearing in people, and then issued\u00a0guidance to laboratories on how to interpret rRT-PCR test results when testing specimens from patients with known pig exposure. Since then, CDC has monitored how the diagnostic kit has performed in detecting variant infections and has updated guidance and virus-specific assay materials (called reagents) to make sure the tests are able to detect these viruses as they have evolved.\nIn April 2013, shortly after the first influenza A(H7N9) human infections in China were reported and within days of China CDC sharing gene sequences of the H7N9 virus, U.S. CDC quickly modified and then quality-checked CDC\u2019s existing\u00a0H7 rRT-PCR test and drafted protocols and guidance for its use. On April 22, 2013, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an Emergency Use Authorization and the H7 rRT-PCR test with test components and CDC guidance were made available to public health laboratories so they would be able to test for H7N9 viruses too.\nTop of PageInternational Reagent Resource\nWhile RT-PCR is fast and accurate, it requires a steady stream of laboratory supplies called reagents (primers, probes and enzymes) to perform testing, which can become scarce or costly during outbreaks when testing demands increase.\nTo address this potential shortcoming, in 2008 CDC established the Influenza Reagent Resource (IRR) as a warehouse for CDC-developed influenza supplies that laboratories need to carry out basic research; develop diagnostics, vaccines and drugs; and conduct surveillance for emerging influenza threats. During the pandemic, the IRR proved to be a critical resource in terms of providing domestic and international laboratories with the supplies needed to test for the new 2009 H1N1 virus.\nTen years later, the IRR is firmly established as a central component of influenza research, surveillance and diagnostic testing in the United States. Further, it also has been expanded to include production and distribution of additional CDC-developed reagents for a wider range of pathogens that are within the scope of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD).Some of the newer additions include reagents for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV), meningitis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The program\u2019s broader scope is reflected in a new name, the International Reagent Resource.\nWith regard to pandemic preparedness, public health laboratories across the globe continue to use the reagents they receive from the IRR for surveillance of novel influenza viruses (such as H7N9 and H5N1) in tandem with the World Health Organization (WHO) Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS).external icon For influenza and other pathogens, CDC\u2019s subject matter experts provide technical guidance and oversight to ensure that IRR acquires, authenticates, manufactures and distributes quality-controlled reagents that support global surveillance efforts.\nTop of PageAdvances in Tests Used in Clinical Settings\n\nCompared to ten years ago, clinicians now have more tests available for detection of influenza viruses in respiratory specimens, including a wider selection of highly accurate molecular assays (some rapid, some not), and improved rapid influenza antigen detection tests (RIDTs).\nRapid and accurate diagnosis of influenza virus infection facilitates timely patient management for seasonal influenza as well as pandemic influenza. Influenza testing has been used to inform decisions on the use of antiviral drugs for treatment, to avoid misuse of antibiotics for treatment, and to reduce the need for other diagnostic tests. Influenza testing also can be helpful in informing recommendations for sick people living with others who are at high risk of developing serious influenza complications. See\u00a0Guide for considering influenza testing when influenza viruses are circulating in the community for more information.)\nThe need for better rapid influenza tests and clear rapid test guidance for clinicians became apparent during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, when false-negative rapid antigen detection test results contributed to delays and missed opportunities in treating pandemic flu virus-infected patients with antiviral drugs; and delays in implementing infection control measures for such patients. [5]\nShortly after the pandemic, CDC and partners began working to address issues with rapid antigen detection tests available at the time, reaching an important milestone in 2017 when rapid influenza antigen detection tests (RIDTs) were reclassified by FDA (described in more detail, below) and held to higher standards.\nIn June 2014, a new kind of rapid influenza test was approved by FDA (the Alere (TM) i Influenza A&B test by Alere Scarborough, Inc D/B/A Binax, Inc, now owned by Abbott and called the ID NOWTIM Influenza A&B) external iconwhich detects flu A and B viruses by detecting the PB2 flu virus gene in respiratory specimens. This approval marked the beginning of a new category of tests, referred to as rapid influenza molecular assays.\nRapid influenza molecular assays are a relatively new type of influenza diagnostic test. These tests are similar to RT-PCR (which is also a molecular process and currently the gold standard for influenza virus detection), in that both tests use nucleic acid amplification, which detects influenza viruses in a respiratory specimen by amplifying (multiplying) certain nucleic acids (building blocks of genes) in the influenza virus genome.\nSince 2014, other rapid influenza molecular assays have been approved by FDA and are available for use in clinical settings. Of those, some are approved for point-of-care or bedside use, and do not require a clinical laboratory, including Cobas\u00ae Influenza A/B and Cobas\u00ae Influenza A/B RSV Assay by Roche Molecular Diagnostics; Xpert Xpress Flu and Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV by Cepheid; Accula Flu A/Flu B assay by Mesa Biotech Inc,; and ID Now TM by Abbot.\nRapid influenza molecular assays have a strong ability to identify correctly patients with evidence of influenza virus infection (referred to as high sensitivity, greater than 90%) and a strong ability to identify correctly patients without evidence of influenza virus infection, referred to as high specificity (90-100%). These assays produce results in 15 to 30 minutes, making them a convenient option for clinical management of patients. Other rapid influenza molecular assays (such as the Cobas\u00ae Influenza A/B & RSV Assay by Roche Molecular Diagnostics) are approved that detect influenza A and B viruses and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in respiratory specimens. These tests are particularly useful in the clinical management of young children with acute respiratory illness, but can be used for persons of all ages.\nAdditionally, a number of other influenza molecular assays are FDA-approved, for use in a moderately complex or complex hospital clinical laboratory. These assays may take more than one hour to produce results. Many of these molecular assays detect influenza A and B viruses as well as other respiratory viruses such as adenovius, coronavirus, human metapneumovirus, human rhinovirus/enterovirus, parainfluenza virus, and RSV. Some also detect some respiratory bacterial infections.\nBoth rapid molecular and other molecular assays are more accurate than previously available influenza tests for use in clinical settings. These advances in molecular technology provide more-accurate influenza testing results and are likely to improve clinical management of patients with suspected influenza in ambulatory care clinics and emergency departments, and in hospitalized patients as well.\nWith regard to rapid influenza antigen detection tests (RIDTs), to address the issues identified during the pandemic, in 2011 the CDC, the Joint Commission, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), the Medical College of Wisconsin (MCW) and other public and private partners addressed key RIDT-related issues by:\n\nCreating the first method for systematically evaluating commercially available RIDTs, described in a 2012 Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) article\nEnhancing awareness among clinicians of appropriate RIDT protocols with new courses, videos and decision-making tools, and;\nWorking with FDA to reclassify RIDTs from Class I to Class II with Special Controls, thereby holding current and new RIDTs to higher performance standards.\n\nReclassification means that RIDTs are now subject to the following requirements [6]:\n\nManufacturers must test their RIDTs annually to ensure they can detect currently circulating seasonal flu viruses. RIDTs with lower sensitivity to those flu viruses will need to indicate so on their labeling.\nRIDTs must meet minimum performance criteria, such as high sensitivity and high specificity to detect flu viruses in respiratory specimens compared to RT-PCR or viral culture. This means that currently FDA-approved RIDTs will now be more accurate in detecting flu viruses in respiratory specimens than previous RIDTs.\nIn the event of a pandemic, manufacturers must test the reactivity of their RIDTs with the newly emergent flu virus as soon as virus samples become available.\nSince 2017 when reclassification of RIDTs occurred, manufacturers have made positive, steady changes to rapid influenza antigen detection tests, but more work still needs to be done.\n\nTop of PageSurveillance\nRight-sizing initiative \n\nThe massive amount of laboratory testing that occurred during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic provided an opportunity for researchers to identify the optimal levels of influenza surveillance and laboratory testing needed in the United States, including ways to improve efficiency.\nTo answer those questions, in 2010, CDC and the Association of Public Health laboratories (APHL) began developing a \u201cright-size\u201d approach to influenza virologic surveillance which was based on extensive input from public health laboratories and stakeholders. Since then, this right-size approach has helped public health laboratories to:\n\nstandardize virologic surveillance practices, determine the optimal number of specimens to test to produce statistical confidence in resulting data, and define public health surveillance priorities;\nadopt requirements, resources and statistical calculators that aid in planning and justifying budget and resource requests;\nincrease the understanding and support from political leaders and the public;\nspeak a common language between laboratories and epidemiologists; and\nassist decision makers in analyzing the impacts of budget decisions on national surveillance objectives, especially with regard to pandemic preparedness capacity.\n\nTop of PageAutomated transmission of laboratory reports\nIn addition to identifying the optimum \u201csampling\u201d strategy, major improvements in sharing this data have taken place. In March 2010, five laboratories were routinely sharing data electronically with CDC. Today, all public health laboratories at the state level and some local public health and clinical laboratories send data electronically to CDC\u2019s Influenza Division This increase has improved the timeliness and completeness of reporting, for both seasonal influenza surveillance activities and the identification of novel influenza A viruses.\nIncorporation of NCHS mortality data\nIn collaboration with the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), since the 2015-2016 flu season CDC\u2019s Influenza Division has used mortality data collected from death certificates and reported to NCHS as the principal tool to track influenza-associated mortality in the United States.\nThe shift to NCHS data marked a significant advance in the capacity to track flu mortality, owing in part to efforts made by NCHS to improve the timeliness of jurisdiction reporting and modernize the infrastructure of national vital statistics, all of which resulted in a system capable of supporting near real-time surveillance of most deaths in the United States.\nThe new system presents deaths by the date of occurrence rather than by the date on which deaths were registered. It also provides a consistent case definition and covers nearly all deaths occurring in the United States, which is an improvement over the previous (now retired) system which accounted for only 25 percent of all US deaths.\nInclusion of electronic data in ILINet\n\nCDC\u2019s U.S. Outpatient Influenza-Like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet) collects data each week from up to 3,500 outpatient health care providers across all 50 states, Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Each week, these health care providers report the total number of patients seen, and the number of patients seen with influenza-like illness (ILI), by five age groups. The process of reporting numbers of total patients and ILI patients was labor-intensive, sometimes leading to reporting delays and dips in participation. Since the pandemic, more ILINet providers have used electronic health records in determining ILI and patient visits, thereby reducing the reporting burden and providing more-comprehensive, efficient and timely surveillance. ILINet now captures more patient visits: during the 2018-19 season, more than one million patient visits were reported weekly, almost double the number of patient visits reported weekly during the 2009 pandemic.\nAntiviral resistance testing\nAnother step forward in surveillance is the number of public health laboratories in the U.S. that test for resistance to influenza antiviral medications, which increased from four laboratories before the 2009 H1N1 pandemic to 20 laboratories in 2019. This improvement was accomplished through training courses, site visits, technical and other support from CDC. In addition, four laboratories are now able to conduct advanced testing for antiviral drug resistance, using a more sensitive and complex procedure. Since 2018, CDC\u2019s influenza laboratories have been testing seasonal and animal viruses for susceptibility to the newest anti-influenza drug \u2013 baloxavir marboxil (Xofluza) and a CDC-developed assay is now being implemented at the public health laboratory designated for antiviral testing (NIRC, Albany NY). Lastly, in collaboration with a World Health Organization (WHO) expert group, reference laboratory materials for detection and reporting of influenza drug resistance have been developed and shared with laboratories around the world.\nTop of PageThe Burden of Influenza\nDuring the pandemic, influenza hospitalization rates increased, particularly among groups of people at high risk of developing serious flu complications.\nThe Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET) conducts population-based surveillance for laboratory-confirmed influenza-related hospitalizations in children and adults. It has provided critical data for:\n\ninforming policy and decision making, especially with regard to vaccine and antiviral prioritization;\nevaluating the effectiveness and safety of pandemic vaccine; and,\nidentifying groups at high risk for severe flu complications.\n\nOver the course of the pandemic, CDC refined and revised its hospitalization surveillance methods, eventually developing a way to use FluSurv-NET data to estimate the range of 2009 pandemic flu illnesses, hospitalizations and deaths (also referred to as \u2018estimates of flu burden\u2019) in the United States.\nSince the 2009 pandemic, this method of estimation has been applied at the end of each flu season as a means of illustrating the national impact of seasonal flu. In 2019, CDC also began providing on a weekly basis preliminary estimates of the burden of influenza during flu season.\nBurden of influenza averted through vaccination\n\nCDC also developed estimates of the number of flu illnesses, hospitalizations and deaths prevented by flu vaccination each flu season. These estimates are made with mathematical models that combine illness rates, vaccine coverage, and vaccine effectiveness, to estimate the amount of flu that would have occurred without flu vaccination. The amount of flu that was prevented by vaccination was the difference between what would have occurred and what was estimated to have actually occurred. CDC has continued to estimate the benefits of influenza vaccination each season. Now, CDC and its partners are better able to communicate the benefits of flu vaccination and provide clear evidence on the public health impact that vaccination can have in reducing flu illness.\nTop of PageVaccine effectiveness monitoring\nWhile FluSurv-NET provided vaccine effectiveness (VE) data during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, the US Flu VE Network has yielded in-depth data about how well flu vaccines are working each flu season since its inception in 2005.\nSeasonal VE data are instrumental in making vaccine policy decisions and improving virus selection to update the composition of seasonal vaccines. VE data are also pivotal to understanding the epidemiology and severity of pandemic and seasonal influenza and to mounting an appropriate responses.\nFollowing the pandemic, multiple improvements were made to the US Flu VE Network including expanding the number of sites, increasing enrollment, improving the timeliness of data collection and reporting, and building an infrastructure for conducting special studies to improve the benefits of vaccines. In addition, in 2016-17 CDC established the Hospitalized Adult Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Network (HAIVEN), which focuses on VE among severely ill adults, as opposed to VE among persons seen as outpatients.\nTop of PageWith regard to available data, at the time of the pandemic, VE studies had shown that influenza vaccination reduced the risk of mild or moderately severe influenza by approximately half among children and adults, but there were gaps in knowledge about how well the vaccine worked in preventing lab-confirmed influenza among pregnant women and in preventing life-threatening influenza among children and adults.\nVE data directly influence policymakers\u2019 decisions regarding influenza vaccination policy both in the United States and in other countries, so over the last 10 years CDC has created partnerships and funded research to address major VE knowledge gaps, all with an eye toward advancing vaccination efforts in the U.S. and internationally.\nPregnant Women\n\nThe first CDC-funded study to address these gaps, which was also the first to use laboratory-confirmed influenza outcomes to assess VE among pregnant women, was published in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases in January 2014. This study, which looked at Kaiser Permanente health plan members in two regions, showed that influenza vaccination reduced their risk of flu illness by half during 2010 to 2012, indicating that flu vaccine works about as well in pregnant women as in other young, healthy adults. The study showed influenza vaccine effectiveness estimates among pregnant women were similar to those found in other studies among young adults, which ranged from 44% to 51% from 2010 to 2012.\nSee\u00a0Study Finds Flu Vaccine Reduces Risk of Flu Illness in Pregnant Women by Half for more information.\nThe second CDC-funded study was published in Clinical Infectious Diseases in October 2018: it was the first study to show that vaccination protects pregnant women against flu-associated hospitalization.\nTo conduct this study, CDC partnered with a number of other public health agencies and health care systems in Australia, Canada, Israel, and the United States through the Pregnancy Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Network (PREVENT), which consists of health care systems with integrated laboratory, medical, and vaccination records. Sites retrospectively examined medical records of more than two million women who were pregnant from 2010 through 2016 to identify those who were hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed flu.\nKey findings of this study include the following:\n\nOver the course of six flu seasons, getting a flu shot reduced a pregnant woman\u2019s risk of being hospitalized from flu by an average of 40 percent.\nMore than 80 percent of pregnancies overlapped with flu season, underscoring the likelihood that pregnant women will be exposed to flu at some point during their pregnancy.\nFlu vaccine was equally protective for pregnant women with underlying medical problems such as asthma and diabetes, which also increase the risk of serious medical complications including a worsening of those chronic conditions.\nFlu vaccine was equally protective for women during all three trimesters.\n\nSee Flu Vaccine Reduces Risk of Flu Hospitalization Among Pregnant Women for more information.\nChildren and Adults:\nIn March 2014 another critical gap was filled, when the first study to estimate VE in children against flu admissions to pediatric intensive care units (PICUs) was published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases. CDC researchers found that getting a flu vaccine reduces a child\u2019s risk of flu-related intensive care hospitalization by 74%, illustrating the important protection flu vaccine can provide to children against more-serious flu outcomes.\nResearchers analyzed the medical records of 216 children age 6 months through 17 years admitted to 21 PICUs in the United States during the 2010-2011 and 2011-2012 flu seasons.\nThough flu vaccination was associated with a significant reduction in risk of PICU admission, flu vaccine coverage was relatively low among the children in this study: only 18 percent of flu cases admitted to the ICU had been fully vaccinated.\nMore than half (55 percent) of PICU cases had at least one underlying chronic medical condition that placed them at higher risk of serious flu-related complications.\nSee\u00a0New Study Shows Flu Vaccine Reduced Children\u2019s Risk of Intensive Care Unit Flu Admission by Three-Fourths for more information.\nIn August 2018, a CDC-supported study published in Vaccine was the first to provide statistically significant VE estimates for adults against hospitalization and admission to ICU.\nThe study was conducted over four flu seasons from 2012 to 2015 and found that flu vaccination prevented severe disease:\n\nFlu vaccination among adults reduced the risk of being admitted to the hospital with flu and placed in a general ward bed by 37 percent.\n\n\nFlu vaccination was even more effective in preventing the most severe forms of flu and reduced the risk of being admitted to an ICU with flu by 82 percent.\n\nBecause flu vaccine varies in how well it works and people who are vaccinated may still get sick, the study also looked at whether flu vaccination reduced the severity of illness among hospitalized people who were vaccinated compared to those who were unvaccinated and found that:\n\nAmong adults who were admitted to the hospital with flu, vaccinated adults were 59 percent less likely to have very severe illness resulting in ICU admission than those who had not been vaccinated.\nAmong adults in the ICU with flu, vaccinated patients on average spent 4 fewer days in the hospital than those who were not vaccinated previously.\n\nThe study was a collaborative project with CDC, conducted through the Southern Hemisphere Influenza and Vaccine Effectiveness Research and Surveillance project, which prospectively enrolled hospitalized adults 18 years and older from 2012 to 2015 in Auckland, New Zealand. Eligible hospitalized patients were those who had an overnight admission with acute respiratory illness. Once enrolled in the study, patients self-reported their flu vaccination status and were tested for flu infection by RT-PCR.\nSee Study Shows Flu Vaccine Reduces Risk of Severe Illness\u00a0for more information.\nTop of PageIn February 2018, the complex process of making CVVs for avian H5 and H7 influenza viruses was streamlined by the Federal Select Agent Program with its decision to remove the requirement for live bird lethality testing.\nH5 and H7 avian influenza viruses are classified as Select Agents until it is shown that the viruses are low-pathogenic (unable to cause disease and mortality in chickens in a laboratory setting).\nPreviously, live bird lethality testing was used to determine whether an avian influenza CVV was highly pathogenic or low pathogenic, and thus if it should managed as a Select Agent.\nNow, H5 and H7-derived CVVs no longer need to be tested in live birds to show low pathogenicity. Instead, other data may be submitted in lieu of bird lethality testing.\nThe Federal Select Agent Program is managed jointly by the Division of Select Agents and Toxins at the CDC, and the Agriculture Select Agent Services at the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.\nPrevention\nInfluenza Vaccines\nCDC and its partners have made significant progress in influenza surveillance; diagnostics; characterizing viruses for vaccine strain selection; and developing systems to evaluate the effectiveness of influenza vaccines over the last ten years.\nFor example, with regard to vaccine development, by using newer production technologies CDC can now identify and provide candidate vaccine viruses for novel influenza threats to manufacturers within a matter of weeks.\nThis and other improvements have helped to better protect the public from seasonal and pandemic influenza threats through vaccination. However, to more fully protect Americans from seasonal and pandemic flu, more effective vaccines are needed and more people still need to receive annual flu vaccines.\nIn line with that public health mission, more doses of seasonal vaccines and different vaccine products are available than ever before. In addition to trivalent inactivated vaccine and live attenuated influenza vaccine, the following vaccines have been approved by the FDA and are now available:\n\na\u00a0high dose vaccine that is designed specifically for\u00a0people 65 and older to help create a stronger antibody response;\na\u00a0trivalent flu vaccine made with adjuvant (an ingredient added to vaccine that helps create a stronger immune response), which was approved for people 65 years of age and older;\nthe first U.S.-approved cell-based flu vaccine, which can potentially be made more quickly than traditional egg-based vaccines and does not require a large supply of eggs to produce;\nquadrivalent (four component) flu vaccines that protect against both lineages of influenza B viruses thus offering expanded protection against circulating influenza viruses; and,\nrecombinant influenza vaccines, which do not require an egg-grown vaccine virus or eggs to produce, and which may be manufactured more quickly than egg-based vaccines.\n\nCDC is currently exploring new ways to further improve influenza vaccine through the influenza vaccine improvement initiative (iVii). The initiative includes two primary goals.\nGoal 1: Build the evidence base for developing more-effective influenza vaccines, and increase the impact of vaccines that are currently available.\nThis goal points to the need for deeper data, so during the 2018-19 season, CDC increased the number and scope of VE Network participants by over 1,500 children and adults, bringing the total number of participants enrolled to more than 10,500.\nCDC also is increasing the diversity of people who can be enrolled in studies and has expanded VE monitoring through innovative use of health care and other data sources outside of the US Flu VE Network. The laboratory process of evaluating vaccine response through the use of enhanced serologic and cellular testing has also been improved.\nGoal 2: Increase the capacity of CDC laboratories to select, develop, evaluate and perform virus characterization to provide candidate vaccine viruses.\nTo accomplish this, CDC is employing state-of-the-art technologies to increase the volume of laboratory testing being done. CDC also is working on developing new assays for manufacturers and regulatory laboratories, and planning evaluation projects that support vaccine improvement.\nCDC also is focusing on expanding and improving global virus detection, and improving vaccine effectiveness monitoring. This is being done through the expansion of Next Generation Sequencing and fully transitioning to the Sequence-First initiative described earlier. In the process, CDC has also worked with partners to automate the pipeline used to produce, store and share the enormous volume of NGS data.\nCDC also is piloting an advanced laboratory strategy to identify viruses, using antigenic data that are likely to predominate in the human population in future influenza seasons.\nCDC meets regularly with vaccine manufacturers and other WHO Collaborating Centers and Essential Regulatory Laboratories including FDA\u2019s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research to share information on a number of vaccine-related topics.\nTopics include the availability of candidate vaccine viruses for use in the development and production of seasonal influenza vaccines, the availability of protocols and reagents needed for the development, standardization, and regulation of influenza vaccines, and to discuss potential issues related to the timely production of seasonal influenza vaccines. The group meets from the time the vaccine composition is announced until vaccines are released for distribution to health care providers, for both the northern and southern hemisphere influenza seasons.\nSeparately, frequent Flu Risk Management Meetings serve as a venue to discuss issues relating to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) response to seasonal and pandemic influenza. Subjects for discussion include but are not limited to seasonal surveillance updates, effectiveness of influenza vaccines, vaccine and antiviral stockpiles, emerging influenza virus surveillance, clinical trial response to influenza outbreaks of novel influenza viruses, and pandemic preparedness.\nTop of PageWhen a pandemic influenza A virus emerges \u2013 like H1N1 in 2009 \u2013 well-matched vaccines may not be available for 6 months or longer, and antiviral medications may be reserved for treatment and be in short supply because of high demand.\nThe goals of community mitigation measures are to delay the spread of the disease and reduce the impact of an influenza pandemic in U.S. communities.\nCommunity mitigation measures are often referred to as Non Pharmaceutical Interventions (or NPIs), and include actions other than use of vaccines and medications that people and communities can take to help slow the spread of a pandemic influenza virus.\nCommunity Mitigation Measures\nCommunity Mitigation Guidelines to Prevent Pandemic Influenza \u2013 United States, 2017 \nBased on lessons learned from the 2009 H1N1 pandemic response and an expanded contemporary NPI evidence base, CDC published updated pre-pandemic planning guidelines \u2013 Community Mitigation Guidelines to Prevent Pandemic Influenza \u2013 United States, 2017 \u2013 in MMWR Recommendations and Reports on April 21, 2017. The guidelines offer free CE credits for healthcare and public health practitioners, and are available at https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/66/rr/pdfs/rr6601.pdfpdf icon.\nThe 2017 guidelines summarize key lessons learned from the 2009 H1N1 pandemic response; encourage state and local public health officials to plan and prepare for implementing NPIs early in an influenza pandemic in community settings; describe new or updated pandemic planning and assessment tools; and provide the latest scientific findings to support updated recommendations on the use of NPIs to help slow the spread and decrease the impact of an influenza pandemic. The 2009 H1N1 pandemic response highlighted that pre-pandemic planning and preparedness \u2013 from local to federal levels \u2013 must be broad, flexible, and multi-sectoral, and emphasized the critical value of public engagement and community preparedness \u2013 including families, schools, and businesses \u2013 for successful NPI implementation during a pandemic. Research conducted during and in the wake of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic documented that public acceptance of NPIs in the United States is generally high, even for disruptive measures like school closures. These findings underscore the importance of pandemic preparedness at all levels of society to ensure timely implementation of community mitigation measures from the onset of a future pandemic, when these measures may be the only tool available in many jurisdictions.\nTo help implement the 2017 guidelines and to assist states and localities with pre-pandemic planning and decision-making in their communities, CDC also published online six plain-language, pre-pandemic NPI planning guides for various audiences and community settings: households, educational settings, workplace settings, community- and faith-based organizations serving vulnerable populations, event planners of large/mass gatherings, and health communicators in community preparedness. The six guides are available.\nCDC continues to conduct and support research to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of NPI implementation in various community settings. Select NPI research references, as well as additional NPI communication, education, and training materials, are available at CDC\u2019s dedicated NPI website.\nTop of PageTreatment\n\nThe number of available, approved and recommended treatment options has increased in the last ten years.\nDuring the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, the influenza antiviral medication oseltamivir (oral oseltamivir, available under the trade name Tamiflu\u00ae) was used extensively for treatment, while zanamivir (inhaled, trade name Relenza\u00ae) was used less.\nOral oseltamivir\u2019s widespread use was due to it being approved, recommended and utilized for treatment of patients hospitalized with severe influenza. It also was recommended for use in hospitalized patients with non-severe influenza, although no antiviral medications were approved by FDA for use in that group.\nOutpatients could be prescribed either oral oseltamivir or inhaled zanamivir, which were both approved for early treatment of uncomplicated influenza by FDA.\nOf the two medications, CDC was more concerned with the possibility of resistance emerging against oseltamivir, which did happen, but not often. The oseltamivir-resistant viruses that did emerge were not transmitted easily from person to person, and zanamivir was used effectively to treat them.\nBeginning in April 2009 and continuing for a few years after the pandemic, the FDA\u2019s Emergency Investigational New Drug (EIND) program provided an application process which authorized investigational use of IV zanamivir for patients with severe and life-threatening influenza.\nLater, on October 23rd, 2009, FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for IV Peramivir. At the time, IV Peramivir was an investigational intravenous antiviral drug used rarely to treat people who had been hospitalized with severe influenza. The drug was held in the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) and distributed by CDC under the EUA. Licensed clinicians were able to request this product through the CDC website electronic request system, and product was delivered directly to hospital facilities until June 2010 when the EUA was terminated.\nTop of PageFollowing the pandemic, in December 2014, IV Peramivir was approved by FDA for early treatment of uncomplicated influenza in outpatients, which also opened up some off-label use in treating influenza in hospitalized patients. Previously, with the exception of the IV Peramivir EUA during the pandemic, oseltamivir and zanamivir were the only recommended antiviral medications for treatment of influenza. (The other approved antiviral drugs \u2013 amantadine and rimantadine \u2013 were not and are still not recommended due to high levels of resistance detected in circulating influenza viruses).\nRoughly three years later, in September 2017, FDA approved the first generic version of oseltamivir.\nOseltamivir, zanamivir and IV peramivir are all neuraminidase-inhibitor influenza antiviral medications, so named because each works by targeting the neuraminidase surface protein of the influenza virus to stop the virus from being released from infected cells and spreading to healthy cells.\nIn December 2018, a new influenza antiviral medication called oral baloxavir marboxil (trade name Xofluza\u00ae) was approved by FDA and is recommended for treatment of influenza. Baloxavir works differently, primarily by preventing an influenza virus from multiplying when it is inside a cell. Because baloxavir works differently, it is in a new class of antiviral medications called cap-dependent endonuclease inhibitors. Like the neuraminidase-inhibitor medications, baloxavir has activity against both influenza A and B viruses. Baloxavir is approved for early treatment of uncomplicated influenza in outpatients aged 12 years and older.\nWith more antiviral medications approved, recommended and available, treatment options have improved for both hospitalized patients with severe influenza and outpatients seeking treatment early for uncomplicated influenza. There remains a gap, however, in approved antiviral treatment options for hospitalized patients with non-severe influenza, although CDC and IDSA (Infectious Diseases Society of America) continue to recommend that those patients be treated with neuraminidase-inhibitor antiviral medications.\nTop of PageDecision-making tools\nRisk assessment (IRAT)\nThe 2009 H1N1 pandemic highlighted the public health value of developing an objective, scientifically based tool for assessing the potential pandemic risk posed to humans by influenza A viruses circulating in animals. To fill that need, CDC developed an evaluation tool now called the Influenza Risk Assessment Tool (IRAT) with help from global animal and human health influenza experts. IRAT launched in 2011 and since then CDC has used it to evaluate the potential risk posed by viruses that are not currently circulating in people. The IRAT relies on input from subject matter experts representing a variety of expertise in the study of influenza viruses. It uses 10 evaluation criteria grouped into major categories including properties of the virus, attributes of the human population, and epidemiology and ecology of the virus, to generate scores that indicate the potential risk of the virus to emerge as a pandemic virus, and the potential impact if it does.\nThe IRAT is not a prediction tool. Rather, the IRAT provides structure to prioritize and maximize investments in pandemic preparedness; identify key gaps in information; document transparently the data and scientific process used to inform management decisions associated with pandemic preparedness; provide a flexible means to easily and regularly update the risk assessment of novel flu viruses as new information becomes available; communicate effectively to the general public, policymakers, public health laboratories and other stakeholders; and provide a means to weigh the 10 evaluation criteria differently depending on whether the intent is to measure the ability of a virus to \u201cemerge\u201d as a pandemic-capable virus, or \u201cimpact\u201d the human population after emerging.\nSince its inception eight years ago, the IRAT has been used by CDC to evaluate and inform pandemic preparedness decisions for 16 viruses, the results of which are listed at Summary of Influenza Risk Assessment Tool (IRAT) Results.\nTop of PageForecasting\nUnlike traditional surveillance systems that lag behind the real-time situation, flu forecasting offers the possibility to look into the future and forecast when and where flu increases will occur, how large the impact of flu will be, and when flu will peak. Forecasts can inform messaging to health care providers regarding influenza vaccination and antiviral treatment for patients, help to prepare for an influx of illnesses and hospitalizations, and be used to guide community mitigation strategies, such as school closures.\nTo support the development of the science of flu forecasting and its application for public health, CDC, through the Epidemic Prediction Initiative (EPI), organized the first FluSight challenge to forecast the timing, intensity, and short-term activity of the influenza season during the 2013-14 season. Each influenza season since then, Influenza Division researchers have worked with CDC\u2019s EPI and other external researchers to improve flu forecasting. CDC provides forecasting teams data, relevant public health forecasting targets, and forecast accuracy metrics evaluated against actual flu activity while each team submits their forecasts based on a variety of methods and data sources each week. During the 2018\u201319 season, forecasting teams provided over 30 national-level forecasts each week.\nThese challenges have provided the scientific and public health community with experience in real-time forecasting, the ability to evaluate forecast accuracy, and familiarity in communicating and applying these forecasts in real-world settings. These experiences are critical to developing a network of forecasters capable of providing results that public health officials can use, both in seasons and during an influenza pandemic.\nForecasts are currently used to inform CDC\u2019s activity summaries provided to public health officials and CDC leadership, and to inform messages to the general public regarding the timing of the influenza season and steps the public can take to protect their health.\nTop of PageInternational work\n\nCDC has strong global ties with other WHO Collaborating Centers for Influenza, National Influenza Centers and ministries of health around the world. These collaborators provided critical data throughout the influenza pandemic on how, when and where the pandemic virus might be changing and if the monovalent pandemic vaccine would continue to be effective in preventing infection.\nCDC\u2019s Influenza Division formed an influenza international capacity-building initiative in 2004, which provided a five-year period of financial support for nine countries to improve laboratory diagnostics and sentinel surveillance for influenza-like illness and severe acute respiratory infection. In 2009, this number increased to 37 countries receiving support under 39 cooperative agreements.\nThus, the 2009 H1N1 pandemic occurred at a time when many of the 37 countries benefited from the newly established influenza surveillance and laboratory capacities. The pandemic provided the ultimate test to determine whether their laboratory diagnostics and surveillance systems were indeed strong enough to manage the massive surges in flu activity that would come their way.\nShortly after the pandemic, eight of the 37 countries transitioned to the program\u2019s second five-year period, called the sustainability period. During this period, financial support was reduced as the programs focused on sustaining the gains made in laboratory diagnostics and surveillance. The countries focused on standardizing foundational aspects of influenza surveillance including regular influenza activity reporting and sending viruses to CDC and other WHO Collaborating Centers, all with an eye toward ensuring preparedness for the next pandemic.\nNow, following 10 years of the pandemic\u2019s race around the globe, which caused hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide, many countries have graduated from the sustainability period to maintenance and some are now developing in-country seasonal influenza vaccination programs based on their influenza surveillance data.\nThe 2009 H1N1 pandemic tested U.S. laboratory and surveillance systems and highlighted many successes along the way, shining a light on one of the biggest takeaways of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic: develop seasonal influenza epidemiology and laboratory capacity that\u2019s flexible enough to handle the next pandemic.\nTop of Page1. http://www.cdc.gov/flu/spotlights/pandemic-global-estimates.htm\n2.

Flu vaccination is especially important for adults 65 years and older, who account for most hospitalizations and deaths from flu and from COVID-19.\nProtect Your Health\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn This Page\n\nFlu Shots for People 65 and OlderOther Preventive ActionsSymptoms and TreatmentAdditional Resources \n\nIt has been recognized for many years that people 65 years and older are at high risk of developing serious complications from flu\u00a0compared with young, healthy adults. This risk is due in part to changes in immune defenses with increasing age. While flu seasons vary in severity, during most seasons, people 65 years and older bear the greatest burden of severe flu disease. In recent years, for example, it\u2019s estimated\u00a0that between 70 percent and 85 percent of seasonal flu-related deaths have occurred in people 65 years and older, and between 50 percent and 70 percent of seasonal flu-related hospitalizations have occurred among people in this age group.\nA Flu Vaccine is the Best Protection Against Flu\nFlu Vaccine Reduces Risk of Flu Illness and Serious OutcomesFlu vaccination has many benefits. It has been shown to reduce flu illnesses and also to reduce the risk of more serious flu outcomes that can result in hospitalization or even death in older people. Flu vaccination has been shown in several studies to reduce severity of illness in people who get vaccinated but still get sick.\nMore\nThe best way to protect against flu and its potentially serious complications is with a flu vaccine.\u00a0CDC recommends that almost everyone 6 months of age and older get a seasonal flu vaccine each year by the end of October. However, as long as flu viruses are circulating, vaccination should continue throughout flu season, even into January or later.\nFlu vaccination is especially important for people 65 years and older because they are at high risk of developing serious complications from flu. Flu vaccines are updated each season as needed to keep up with changing viruses. Also, immunity wanes over a year so annual vaccination is needed to ensure the best possible protection against flu. A flu vaccine protects against the flu viruses that research indicates will be most common during the upcoming season. (See Vaccine Virus Selection\u00a0for this season\u2019s exact vaccine composition.) Flu vaccines for 2020-2021 have been updated from last season\u2019s vaccine to better match circulating viruses. Immunity from vaccination fully sets in after about two weeks.\nBecause of age-related changes in their immune systems, people 65 years and older may not respond as well to vaccination as younger people. Although immune responses may be lower in older people, studiesexternal icon\u00a0have consistently found that flu vaccine has been effective in reducing the risk of medical visits and hospitalizations associated with flu.\nTypes of Flu Shots for People 65 and Older\nPeople 65 years and older should get a flu shot, not a nasal spray vaccine. They can get any flu vaccine approved for use in their age group with no preference for any one vaccine over another. There are regular flu shots that are approved for use in people 65 years and older and there also are two vaccines designed specifically for this group:\nHigh Dose Flu Vaccine\nThe high dose vaccine (brand name Fluzone High-Dose) contains four times the amount of antigen (the inactivated virus that promotes a protective immune response) as a regular flu shot. It is associated with a stronger immune response following vaccination (higher antibody production). Results from a clinical trial of more than 30,000 participants showed that adults 65 years and older who received the high dose vaccine had 24% fewer influenza illnesses as compared to those who received the standard dose flu vaccine. The high dose vaccine has been approved for use in the United States since 2009. Learn more about high dose flu vaccine here.\nAdjuvanted Flu Vaccine\nThe adjuvanted flu vaccine (brand name Fluad) is made with MF59 adjuvant, an additive that can create a stronger immune response to vaccination. In a recent review of multiple vaccine trials, older adults who received a MF59-adjuvated vaccine had a significantly higher immune response than those who received a standard flu vaccine, The adjuvanted\u00a0vaccine was available for the first time in the United States during the 2016-2017 flu season. Learn more about adjuvanted flu vaccine here.\nHigh Dose and Adjuvanted Flu Vaccine Side Effects\nThe high dose and adjuvanted flu vaccines may result in more of the temporary, mild side effects that can occur with standard-dose seasonal shots. Side effects can include pain, redness or swelling at the injection site, headache, muscle ache and malaise, and typically resolve with 1 to 3 days.\nMore information about different types of flu vaccines can be found here.\nGet pneumococcal vaccines\n\nPeople who are 65 years and older also should be up to date with pneumococcal vaccination\u00a0to protect against pneumococcal disease, such as pneumonia, meningitis, and bloodstream infections. Talk to your health care provider to find out which pneumococcal vaccines are recommended for you.\nPneumococcal pneumonia is an example of a serious flu-related complication\u00a0that can cause death. You can get the pneumococcal vaccine your provider recommends when you get a flu vaccine.\n\n\nOther Preventive Actions\nIn addition to getting a flu shot, people 65 years and older should take the same everyday preventive actions\u00a0CDC recommends for everyone,\u00a0including avoiding people who are sick, covering coughs, and washing hands often.\n\n\n\nalert icon \n\n\nIn the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, local governments or public health departments may recommend additional precautions be taken in your community. Follow those instructions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSymptoms and Treatment\nBecause you are at high risk of developing serious flu complications, if you get sick with flu symptoms, call your health care provider right away. There are antiviral drugs\u00a0that can treat flu illness and prevent serious flu complications. CDC recommends prompt treatment for people who have influenza infection or suspected influenza infection and who are at high risk for serious flu complications, including people 65 years and older.\nSymptoms:\nFlu symptoms include fever, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, body aches, headache, chills and fatigue. Some people may also have vomiting and diarrhea. People may be infected with flu and have respiratory symptoms without a fever.\nTreatment:\n\nTreatment should begin as soon as possible because antiviral drugs work best when started early (within 48 hours after symptoms start).\nFor you to get an antiviral drug, a health care provider needs to write a prescription. These medicines fight against flu by keeping flu viruses from making more viruses in your body.\nAntiviral drugs can make your flu illness milder and make you feel better faster. They may also prevent serious health problems that can result from flu illness.\nThere are four FDA-approved influenza antiviral drugs\u00a0recommended by CDC this season that can be used to treat the flu.\n\nWhat are the emergency warning signs of flu?People experiencing these warning signs should obtain medical care right away.\n\nIn children\n\nFast breathing or trouble breathing\nBluish lips or face\nRibs pulling in with each breath\nChest pain\nSevere muscle pain (child refuses to walk)\nDehydration (no urine for 8 hours, dry mouth, no tears when crying)\nNot alert or interacting when awake\nSeizures\nFever above 104\u00b0F\nIn children less than 12 weeks, any fever\nFever or cough that improve but then return or worsen\nWorsening of chronic medical conditions\n\n\n\nIn adults\n\nDifficulty breathing or shortness of breath\nPersistent pain or pressure in the chest or abdomen\nPersistent dizziness, confusion, inability to arouse\nSeizures\nNot urinating\nSevere muscle pain\nSevere weakness or unsteadiness\nFever or cough that improve but then return or worsen\nWorsening of chronic medical conditions\n\n\n\n\nThese lists are not all inclusive.

While CDC conducts annual education and awareness campaigns with the goal of increasing flu vaccination, this season, extra work has been done in this area, including the launch of a new campaign called: No One Has Time for Flu.\nThe campaign is the result of a collaborationpdf iconexternal icon between The Ad Council, the American Medical Association (AMA), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the CDC Foundation, which along with AMA provided campaign funding. The campaign aims to increase vaccine uptake overall, but puts a particular emphasis on reaching African American and Hispanic/LatinX communities, populations that can be \u00a0disproportionately affected by flu illness and serious flu complications, but are less likely to be vaccinated.\nCampaign public service announcements (PSAs) presented by the Ad Council run on space donated by TV stations, media outlets, and social media platforms. Many campaign assets, including television public service announcements, are available for viewing and sharing at http://getmyflushot.adcouncilkit.org/external icon.\nIn preparation for the campaign, the Ad Council arranged for quantitative research surveys to be fielded, to help understand behaviors and attitudes towards flu vaccines in 2020 among African American and Hispanic uncommitted consumers, defined as people who had not yet decided to get vaccinated this season.\n\nSurvey findings showed that 52% of Hispanic adults and 43% of African American adults said they are likely to get a flu shot in 2020. This compares to 63% among White adults.\nNearly 40% of both African American and Hispanic respondents remain uncommitted, which compares to just 24% of whites. Research suggests inertia is a big factor in why African Americans and Hispanics do not get a flu vaccine. The top reason given for not getting vaccinated was \u201cI never get the flu shot/not something I do.\u201d\nThe Ad Council partnered with fluent360, a creative agency based in Chicago, to develop the creative concept and materials for the No One Has Time for Flu campaign. The PSAs highlight the different circumstances many people are experiencing as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the fact that, now, more than ever, no one has time to be sick with flu.

Participants, including director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health Dr. Anthony Fauci, urged the public and health care professionals to follow the CDC recommendation that everyone 6 months and older get vaccinated against flu annually\nRoll Your #SleeveUp to Fight Flu!\nEncourage your followers on social media to roll up their sleeves for an annual flu vaccine by featuring photos of yourself and others in your community getting a flu vaccine or showing off a bandage after getting a flu vaccine.\n#SleeveUp\nCDC also released multiple reports on the 2019-2020 flu season today, including influenza vaccination coverage estimates among the U.S. public, health care providers and pregnant women. The agency also released updated preliminary estimates on the burden of flu last season, and for the first time, estimates for the burden of flu averted by vaccination last season.\nDuring 2019-2020, CDC estimates there were 38 million flu illnesses, 18 million flu-associated medical visits, 400,000 flu hospitalizations and 22,000 flu-associated deaths. These numbers are lower than the in-season burden estimates\u00a0provided last season, because they were calculated using more recently available data on flu testing practices in patients hospitalized with flu, which is a key input in the model CDC uses to generate these estimates. Influenza testing has increased in recent years, which can cause preliminary burden estimates to change. An example is the preliminary burden estimates made for the 2017-2018 season, when an initial estimate of 79,000 deaths, was later updated to 61,000. The CDC website has more information on how CDC estimates flu burden.\nCDC also provided new estimates on the burden of flu averted by vaccination last season. CDC estimates that flu vaccination prevented 7.5 million flu illnesses, 3.7 million flu medical visits, 105,000 flu hospitalizations and 6,300 flu deaths. These estimates are based on vaccine effectiveness estimates from 2019-2020, as well as data on vaccine coverage during last flu season which were also released by CDC today.\nCDC\u2019s influenza vaccination coverage reports show that overall flu vaccination coverage (among people 6 months and older) during 2019-2020 increased from the previous season to nearly 52%. This is the highest flu vaccine coverage for this age group recorded since CDC recommended universal influenza vaccination of all persons 6 months and older in 2010. However, this figure also means that nearly half of U.S. residents did not get vaccinated. While flu vaccination increased overall for both children and adults, coverage did not increase among certain racial and ethnic groups. Black children have lower flu vaccination coverage than children of all other racial/ethnic groups. Hispanic adults and black adults continue to have lower flu vaccination coverage than white adults. Additionally, only 44% of people with chronic conditions were vaccinated against flu last season. And while flu vaccination coverage among pregnant women increased from 54% to 61% that still leaves a significant number of pregnant women and their babies unprotected from flu. Pregnant women and people with certain chronic conditions are among those at higher risk for flu complications, so it is especially important for them to be vaccinated against flu annually. Lastly, CDC\u2019s flu vaccination coverage estimates for health care workers show that 81% were vaccinated against flu last season. Coverage was highest among physicians (98%) and lowest among aides and assistants (72%).\nCDC has emphasized the added importance of getting a flu vaccine during the 2020-2021 flu season because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. While it is unclear how the pandemic will affect the flu season, CDC is preparing for COVID-19 and seasonal flu to spread at the same time. Co-circulation could place a tremendous burden on our health care system and result in many illnesses, hospitalizations and deaths. Getting a flu vaccine is something easy people can do to protect themselves and their loved ones and to help reduce the spread of flu this fall and winter. Flu vaccine will not protect against COVID-19. But vaccination has many other benefits and is part of a comprehensive public health strategy to reduce the burden of flu, which can flatten the curve of respiratory illnesses overall, help protect essential workers from flu, and preserve medical resources for care of patients with COVID-19. October is a good time to get vaccinated, but as long as flu viruses are circulating, vaccination can continue\u2014even in January or later. The more people who are vaccinated against flu; the more people are protected from flu.\nNow More Than Ever\nCDC recommends everyone 6 months and older be vaccinated against flu. It protects the person getting vaccinated and the people around them. Flu vaccines have been shown to prevent flu illness and reduce the risk of hospitalizations and deaths. Flu vaccination is proven to help protect pregnant women and people with chronic health conditions while reducing the burden of flu on our communities and health care system. This year, especially, it will be most important to protect those at higher risk for flu complications. Many of these people are also at high risk for COVID-19 illness or serious outcomes. It is also important for caregivers and essential workers to protect themselves and those around them from flu by getting a flu vaccine.\nVaccine and Administration\nManufacturers estimate between 194 and 198 million doses of flu vaccine will be available this season. Approximately 99% of the flu vaccines will be quadrivalent. COVID-19 activity may affect when, where and how flu vaccines will be given. CDC has provided interim guidance for vaccination to help immunization providers ensure safe administration of vaccines during the pandemic. So far, nearly 90 million doses of flu vaccine have been distributed in the United States.\nVaccination Coverage\n\nFlu Vaccination Coverage, United States, 2019-20 Influenza Season\nFlu Vaccination Coverage Among Pregnant Women \u2013 United States, 2019-20 Flu Season\nInfluenza Vaccination Coverage Among Health Care Personnel \u2014 United States, 2020\u201321 Influenza Season\n\n2019-2020 Influenza Season Estimates\n\nEstimated Influenza Illnesses, Medical visits, Hospitalizations, and Deaths in the United States \u2014 2019\u20132020 influenza season\u200b\u200b\nEstimated Influenza Illnesses, Medical visits, and Hospitalizations Averted by Vaccination in the United States \u2014 2019\u20132020 Influenza Season\u200b\n\n2020- 2021 Flu Season Updates\n\n2020 NFID Influenza/Pneumococcal News Conferenceexternal icon\n2020-2021 Flu Season Information\nCDC\u2019s 2020-2021 Seasonal Flu Vaccination Campaign Digital Toolkit\n\nHealth Care Provider Resources\n\nPrevention and Control of Seasonal Influenza with Vaccines: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices \u2014 United States, 2020\u201321 Influenza Season\nCDC Updates for Health Care Providers about the 2020-2021 Flu Season\nResources to help health care professionals make a strong flu vaccine recommendation\n\n\nFull Infographicimage icon \u200b\nEstimated Influenza Illnesses, Medical visits, and Hospitalizations Averted by Vaccination in the United States \u2014 2019\u20132020 Influenza Season\u200b", "reports": [{"diseases": ["COVID-19"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "2010-03-23 00:00:00", "locations": [6255150]}]}{"url": "https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/2019-2020.html", "date_of_publication": "", "headline": "Estimated Influenza Illnesses, Medical visits, Hospitalizations, and Deaths in the United States \u2014 2019\u20132020 Influenza Seaso", "main_text": "Estimated Influenza Illnesses, Medical visits, Hospitalizations, and Deaths in the United States \u2014 2019\u20132020 Influenza Season   \n\n\nOn This Page\n\nIntroduction 2019\u20132020 Burden EstimatesConclusionBurden Estimates Limitations Flu Burden InfographicReferences \n\nIntroduction\nThis web page provides estimates on the burden of influenza (flu) in the United States for the 2019\u20132020 flu season. For the past several years, CDC has used a mathematical model to estimate the numbers of influenza illnesses, medical visits, hospitalizations, and deaths (1-4). The methods used to calculate the estimates have been described previously (1-2). CDC uses the estimates of the burden of flu in the population to inform policy and communications related to influenza prevention and control.\nBenefits of Flu Vaccination for the 2019-2020 SeasonCDC estimates the influenza illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths prevented by seasonal influenza vaccination.\nMore2019\u20132020 Burden Estimates\nInfluenza activity in the United States during the 2019\u20132020 season began to increase in November and was consistently high through January and February.\u00a0 The season was characterized by two consecutive waves of activity, beginning with influenza B viruses and followed by A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses. Overall, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were the most commonly reported influenza viruses this season. Activity began to decline in March, perhaps associated with community prevention measures for COVID-19 (5-6). The 2019-20 season is described as having moderate severity; however, the effect of influenza differed by age group and the severity of the season in some age groups was higher. Hospitalization rates among children 0-4 years old and adults 18-49 years old were higher than observed during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic (6).\nCDC estimates that the burden of illness during the 2019\u20132020 season was moderate with an estimated 38 million people sick with flu, 18 million visits to a health care provider for flu, 400,000 hospitalizations for flu, and 22,000 flu deaths \u00a0(Table 1). The number of cases of influenza-associated illness, medically attended illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths were lower than some more recent seasons and similar to other seasons where influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses dominated (7, 8).\nThe 2019\u20132020 influenza season was atypical in that it was severe for children aged 0-4 years and adults 18-49 years where rates of infections, medically attended illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths were higher than those observed during the 2017-2018 season, a recent season with high severity (7). The burden of influenza and the rates of influenza-associated hospitalization are usually higher for the very young and the very old, and while this was observed during the 2019\u20132020 season, rates of hospitalization in adults aged 18-49 years were the highest seasonal rates seen since the 2017-2018 season (Table 2). These rates mean that an estimated 15 million cases of influenza in younger adults (aged 18-49 years), which is the highest number of infections for this age group since CDC began reporting influenza burden estimates in the 2010-11 season.\nCDC\u2019s estimates of hospitalizations and mortality associated with the 2019\u20132020 influenza season show the effects that influenza virus infections can have on society. More than 52,000 hospitalizations occurred in children aged < 18 years and 86,000 hospitalizations among adults aged 18-49 years. Forty-three percent of hospitalizations occurred in older adults aged \u226565 years. Older adults also accounted for 62% of deaths, which is lower than recent previous seasons.\u00a0 These findings continue to highlight that older adults are particularly vulnerable to severe disease with influenza virus infection. An estimated 7,800 deaths (36% of all deaths) occurred among working age adults (aged 18\u201364 years), an age group for which influenza vaccine coverage is often low (9). This also underscores that influenza viruses can affect individuals of any age and prevention measures such as vaccination are important to reducing the impact of the seasonal epidemics on the population and healthcare system.\nDeaths in children with laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infection have been a reportable disease in the United States since 2004; 188 deaths were reported for the 2019-20 season as of September 19, 2020. However, influenza-associated pediatric deaths are likely under-reported, as not all children whose death was related to an influenza virus infection may have been tested for flu (10,11). Therefore, we used a mathematical model to estimate the total number of pediatric deaths based on hospitalization rates and the frequency of death in and out of the hospital using death certificates. We estimate that at least 434 deaths associated with influenza occurred during the 2019-2020 season among children aged <18 years.\nConclusion\nDuring the 2019-2020 influenza season, CDC estimates that influenza was associated with 38 million illnesses, 18 million medical visits, 405,000 hospitalizations, and 22,000 deaths. The influenza burden was higher in young children (0-4 years) and adults (18-49 years) compared with a recent season with the 2017-2018 season, a recent season with high severity, and provides evidence to support how severe seasonal influenza can be at any age.\nBurden Estimates Limitations\nThese estimates are subject to several limitations.\nFirst, rates of influenza-associated hospitalizations are based on data reported to the Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv\u2013NET) through September 2, 2020. Final case counts may differ slightly as further data cleaning from the 2019-2020 season are conducted by FluSurv\u2013NET sites. The most updated crude rates of hospitalization for FluSurv-NET sites are available on FluView Interactive (6).\nSecond, national rates of influenza-associated hospitalizations and in-hospital death were adjusted for the frequency of influenza testing and the sensitivity of influenza diagnostic assays, using a multiplier approach (3). However, data on testing practices during the 2019\u20132020 season were not available at the time of estimation. We adjusted rates using the lowest multiplier from any season between 2010\u20132011 and 2017\u20132018. Burden estimates from the 2019\u20132020 season will be updated at a later date when data on contemporary testing practices become available.\nThird, estimates of influenza-associated illness are made by multiplying the number of hospitalizations by the ratio of illnesses to hospitalizations; estimates of medical visits are made by a similar process.\u00a0 These multipliers are based on data from a prior season, which may not be accurate if patterns of care-seeking have changed.\nFourth, our estimate of influenza-associated deaths relies on information about location of death from death certificates to calculate ratios of deaths occurring in the hospital to deaths occurring outside of the hospital by categories of causes of death. \u00a0However, death certificate data during the 2019\u20132020 season were not available at the time of estimation. We used death certification data from all influenza seasons from 2010\u20132011 through 2017\u20132018 where these data were available from the National Center for Health Statistics. To calculate these ratios, first we calculate the frequency of flu-related deaths reported from our FluSurv-NET surveillance system that have cause of death identified as pneumonia or influenza (P&I), other respiratory or cardiovascular (other R&C), or other non-respiratory, non-cardiovascular (non-R&C).\u00a0 Next, to account for deaths occurring outside of a hospital, we use information from national death certificates to calculate the proportion of deaths from these causes that occur in and out of the hospital. Data to generate these frequencies were not available from the 2019\u20132020 season at the time of estimation, so we used the average frequencies of location of death for each of the cause categories from previous seasons, 2010\u20132011 through 2017\u20132018.\nFifth, estimates of burden were derived from rates of influenza-associated hospitalization, which is a different approach than the statistical models used in older published reports. This makes it difficult to directly compare our estimates for seasons since 2009 to those older reports, though the estimates from our current method are largely consistent with estimates produced with statistical models for similar years (12\u201313). \u00a0However, it is useful to keep in mind that direct comparisons to influenza disease burden decades ago are complicated by large differences in the age of the US population and the increasing number of adults aged \u226565 years.\nTop of PageWhy are these estimates lower than the preliminary in-season burden estimates last updated in April 2020?\nThese estimates are an update to the preliminary in-season 2019-20 burden estimates published April 2020 and are based on more recently available information. The current 2019-20 burden estimates are lower than those provided in April 2020 because of expected changes in available data on flu testing practices in patients hospitalized with flu, as well as unexpected data delays due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in Spring 2020.\nThere is a trade-off between timeliness and accuracy of burden of disease estimates. To provide timely burden estimates to the public, clinicians, and public health decision-makers, CDC uses preliminary data that may lead to over- or under-estimates of the true burden. However, each season\u2019s estimates will be finalized when data on testing practices and deaths for that season are available.\nFor these estimates, we included additional information to better capture flu testing practices at sites in the hospital-based surveillance system, FluSurv-NET, that collects data on patients hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed flu. Flu testing is done at the request of individual clinicians, but not everyone is tested, and flu tests are not perfectly accurate. Thus, reports of laboratory-confirmed flu-related hospitalizations to FluSurv-NET are underestimates of the true number of hospitalizations. To adjust for this, CDC collects data annually from participating FluSurv-NET sites on the amount of flu testing and the type of tests used at the site. This information is used to correct for the underestimates of flu-related hospitalizations. These testing data are often not available for up to 2 years after the end of a flu season, and thus the burden estimates are revised when additional testing data become available.\nThe preliminary in-season 2019-20 burden estimates were made using the highest flu testing rate for each age-group from the 2010-2011 through the 2016-2017 seasons. The current estimates were made using the highest testing rate for each age-group from the 2010-2011 through the 2017-2018 seasons. The additional data from the 2017-2018 flu season, which had high rates of flu testing, resulted in the 2019-2020 flu burden estimates being lower than those estimated earlier.\nIn addition to expected changes in available data on testing practices and patients hospitalized for flu, there were unexpected data delays due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in Spring 2020. The method used to estimate flu-related deaths relies on additional data from FluSurv-NET and the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) (data on cause of death and numbers of deaths that occur inside versus outside of the hospital). The additional mortality data from FluSurv-NET are typically not available for up to 2 years after the end of a flu season. However, data from FluSurv-NET that is usually available at the end of flu season was delayed in 2020 due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe 2019-2020 estimates that are presented here remain preliminary because not all of the data needed for final estimates are available. When additional data become available, these estimates will be updated again, and the results may change.\nMore answers to frequently asked questions about CDC\u2019s influenza burden estimates are available.\n\n\nTable 1: Estimated influenza disease burden, by age group \u2014 United States, 2019-2020 influenza season\n\n\n\nSymptomatic Illnesses\nMedical Visits\nHospitalizations\nDeaths\n\n\nAge group\nEstimate\n95% UI\nEstimate\n95% UI\nEstimate\n95% UI\nEstimate\n95%UI\n\n\n\n\n0-4 yrs\n4,291,677\n(3,065,436, 8,247,015)\n2,875,424\n(2,021,018, 5,544,822)\n29,920\n(21,371, 57,495)\n254\n(84, 554)\n\n\n5-17 yrs\n8,214,257\n(6,551,246, 11,351,951))\n4,271,413\n(3,315,969, 6,011,703)\n22,523\n(17,963, 31,126)\n180\n(35, 439)\n\n\n18-49 yrs\n15,325,708\n(11,798,086, 22,121,677)\n5,670,512\n(4,214,299, 8,383,456)\n86,023\n(66,223, 124,169)\n2,669\n(1,719, 4,601)\n\n\n50-64 yrs\n8,416,702\n(6,918,420, 10,835,295))\n3,619,182\n(2,832,003, 4,780,110)\n89,257\n(73,368, 114,905)\n5,133\n(3,534, 8,750)\n\n\n65+ yrs\n1,946,161\n(1,480,075, 2,883,659)\n1,089,850\n(797,945, 1,621,738)\n176,924\n(134,552, 262,151)\n13,673\n(10,298, 19,568)\n\n\nAll ages\n38,194,505\n(33,672,529, 47,034,054)\n17,526,381\n(15,371,515, 21,930,946)\n404,646\n(352,913, 503,531)\n21,909\n(17,970, 29,053)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: Estimated rates of influenza-associated disease outcomes, per 100,000, by age group \u2014 United States, 2019-2020 influenza season\n\n\n\nIllness rate\nMedical visit rate\nHospitalization rate\nMortality rate\n\n\nAge group\nEstimate\n95% UI\nEstimate\n95% UI\nEstimate\n95% UI\nEstimate\n95% UI\n\n\n\n\n0-4 yrs\n21,922.40\n(15,658.6, 42,126.7)\n14,688.00\n(10,323.6, 28,323.6)\n152.8\n(109.2, 293.7)\n1.3\n(0.4, 2.8)\n\n\n5-17 yrs\n15,364.50\n(12,253.9, 21,233.5)\n7,989.60\n( 6,202.4, 11,244.7)\n42.1\n(33.6, 58.2)\n0.3\n(0.1, 0.8)\n\n\n18-49 yrs\n11,088.20\n( 8,536.0, 16,005.1)\n4,102.60\n( 3,049.1, 6,065.5)\n62.2\n(47.9, 89.8)\n1.9\n(1.2, 3.3)\n\n\n50-64 yrs\n13,375.60\n(10,994.6, 17,219.2)\n5,751.50\n( 4,500.6, 7,596.4)\n141.8\n(116.6, 182.6)\n8.2\n(5.6, 13.9)\n\n\n65+ yrs\n3,600.10\n( 2,737.9, 5,334.4)\n2,016.10\n( 1,476.1, 3,000.0)\n327.3\n(248.9, 484.9)\n25.3\n(19.1, 36.2)\n\n\n\n\n\u202095% Uncertainty intervals\n*Some of the data used to calculate burden estimates are incomplete or not yet available.

The methods used to calculate the estimates have been described previously (1, 2, 6) and are outlined briefly below. CDC uses the estimates of the impact of influenza vaccination to inform policy and communications promoting influenza vaccination as the best way to prevent influenza.\n2019\u20132020 Estimates\nCDC estimates that during the 2019\u20132020 season 38 million people were ill, 18 million people went to a health care provider, 400,000 were hospitalized, and 22,000 died with influenza (7). The season was characterized by two consecutive waves of activity, beginning with influenza B viruses and followed by A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses. Overall, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were the most commonly reported influenza viruses this season. The number of influenza-associated illnesses, medically attended illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths were lower than some more recent seasons and similar to other seasons during which influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses dominated (8).\nInfluenza vaccination prevented an estimated 7.52 million illnesses, 3.69 million medical visits, 105,000 hospitalizations, and 6,300 deaths due to influenza during the 2019-2020 season. The number and proportion of influenza-associated hospitalizations prevented by vaccination during 2019\u20132020 varied by age group, due to age-specific differences in influenza burden, vaccine coverage, and vaccine effectiveness. Vaccination prevented the lowest proportion of illnesses among adults aged 18 to 49 years, the age group in which vaccination coverage is lowest, and among children aged 5-17 years, for whom vaccine effectiveness was low for both influenza B and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses. Vaccination prevented the greatest proportion of outcomes among children aged 6 months to 4 years, an age group in which there was high vaccine uptake and the vaccine effectiveness was greatest.\nInfluenza vaccination is the best way to protect against influenza and associated complications; however, more effective or longer lasting influenza vaccines are needed. Several efforts are currently underway to understand and investigate factors that contribute to reduced or increased vaccine effectiveness and inform changes to vaccine composition, formulations, or production (9-11).\nImprovements in vaccine coverage could also provide a greater public health benefit, producing even greater reductions in illnesses and demands for resources from the health system. During influenza season, the health care system, including outpatient clinics, emergency departments, and hospitals, experience high patient volumes. Any reduction in influenza-associated medical visits and hospitalizations will reduce demands on the healthcare system stressed by the COVID-19 pandemic and improve healthcare providers\u2019 abilities to provide the best care. Strategies to improve influenza vaccine coverage include: using patient reminder/recall systems aided by immunization information systems; expanding access to vaccination at pharmacies, workplaces, and schools; and organizing mobile and/or outdoor vaccination clinics that would allow for social distancing among patients and healthcare providers.\nConclusion\nCDC estimates that influenza vaccination during the 2019\u20132020 influenza season prevented 7.52 million illnesses, 3.69 million medical visits, 105,000 hospitalizations, and 6,300 deaths associated with influenza. This report underscores the benefits of the current vaccination program, but highlights areas where improvements in vaccine uptake and vaccine effectiveness could deliver even greater benefits to the public\u2019s health.\nLimitations\nThese estimates are subject to several limitations. First, influenza vaccination coverage estimates were derived from reports by survey respondents, not vaccination records, and are subject to recall bias. These coverage estimates are based on telephone surveys with relatively low response rates; nonresponse bias may remain after weighting for the survey design. Estimates of the number of persons vaccinated based on these survey data have often exceeded the actual number of doses distributed, indicating that coverage estimates used in this report may overestimate the numbers of illnesses and hospitalizations averted by vaccination. The model of averted illness calculates outcomes directly prevented among persons who were vaccinated. If indirect protection from decreased exposure to infectious persons in a partially vaccinated population (i.e., herd immunity) also occurred, the model would underestimate the number of illnesses and hospitalizations prevented by vaccination. Estimates of the averted burden in older adults, aged \u226565 years, do not reflect the increasing use of high-dose or adjuvanted influenza vaccines, which may have higher effectiveness compared with standard vaccines; nor does the estimate reflect that vaccine effectiveness might continue to decrease with age, reaching very low levels among the oldest adults who also have the highest rates of influenza vaccination. Finally, because the data and methods used to make these calculations are continually updated, current estimates are preliminary and will be updated when final data are available.\nPrevious Estimates\nPrevious estimates of the burden of illness, medical visits, hospitalizations, and deaths related to influenza and prevented by influenza vaccination are available online and in publications (1-5). \u00a0Past seasons\u2019 estimates of influenza disease burden averted by vaccination, using the same methodology as for the 2019-2020 season, are available to provide context for the current season\u2019s estimates.\n2019-2020 Tables for Influenza Burden and Burden-Averted Estimates\n\n\nTable 1: Influenza vaccine coverage, by age group \u2014 United States 2019\u20132020 influenza season\n\n\n\nVaccine coverage *\u00a0\nVaccine effectiveness against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09\u2020\nVaccine effectiveness against influenza B/Victoria\u2020 \n\n\nAge Group\n%\n95% CI\n%\n95% CI\n%\n95% CI\n\n\n\n6 months-4 years\n\n75.5\n74.5\u201376.5\n28\n-6\u201352\n57\n34\u201372\n\n\n\n5-17 yrs\n\n60.2\n59.5\u201360.9\n22\n-4\u201341\n35\n18\u201348\n\n\n\n18-49 yrs\n\n38.4\n37.6\u201339.2\n26\n9\u201339\n45\n30\u201356\n\n\n\n50-64 yrs\n\n50.6\n49.2\u201352.0\n40\n20\u201356\n44\n0\u201368\n\n\n\n\u226565 years\n\n69.8\n68.6\u201371.0\n42\n9\u201364\n34\n-40\u201369\n\n\n\n\n*Estimates from FluVaxView.

Reported hospitalization rates were adjusted using a multiplier to correct for underreporting, which is calculated from the percent of persons hospitalized with respiratory illness who were tested for influenza and the average sensitivity of influenza tests used in the surveillance hospitals. These values were measured from data collected during eight post-pandemic seasons; estimates of underreporting of influenza-related hospitalizations\nAdjusted rates were applied to the U.S. population by age group to calculate the numbers of influenza-associated hospitalizations. The numbers of influenza illnesses were then estimated from hospitalizations based on previously measured ratios that reflect the estimated number of ill persons per hospitalization in each age group (5).\nThe numbers of persons seeking medical care for influenza were then calculated using age group-specific data on the percentages of persons with a respiratory illness who sought medical care, which were estimated from results of the 2010 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey (14).\nAll estimates were rounded to three significant digits.\n\u00a0\nHow does CDC estimate the number of influenza-associated outcomes that were prevented with influenza vaccination?\nThe annual estimates of influenza vaccination coverage by month during each season and the final end-of-season vaccine effectiveness measurements were used to estimate how many persons were not protected by vaccination during the season and thus were at risk for these outcomes.\nThe rate of each outcome among persons at risk was then used to estimate the number of influenza-associated outcomes that would have been expected in the same population if no one had been protected by vaccination. Finally, the averted outcomes attributable to vaccination were calculated as the difference between outcomes in the hypothetical unvaccinated population and the observed vaccinated population.\nEstimates of 2019\u20132020 influenza vaccination coverage by month from July 2019 through April 2020, were based on self-report or parental report of vaccination status using data from the National Immunization Survey for children aged 6 months-17 years and Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey data for adults aged \u226518 years (12).\nVaccine effectiveness estimates for the 2019\u20132020 season were derived from the US Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Network, a group of five academic institutions that conduct annual vaccine effectiveness studies. (13) The network estimates the effectiveness of vaccination for preventing influenza diagnosed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction-positive testing among persons with acute respiratory illness of \u22647 days duration seen in hospitals, emergency departments, or outpatient clinics in communities in\nCalculations were stratified by month of the year to account for annual variations in the timing of disease and vaccination and then summed across the whole season. The prevented fraction was calculated as the number of averted illnesses divided by the total illnesses that would have been expected in an unvaccinated population.\nThe Benefits of Flu Vaccination 2019-2020 Infographic\n\nFull Sized Infographic\nThe Benefits of Flu Vaccination 2019-2020 Infographic (Text Version)\nNearly 52% of the U.S. population aged 6 months and older got a flu vaccine during the 2019-2020 flu season, and this prevented an estimated:\n7.5 million flu illnesses, more than the combined population of Kentucky and Kansas.\n105,000 flu hospitalizations, enough people to fill Michigan Stadium at the University of Michigan.\n6,300 flu deaths, equivalent to saving about 17 lives per day over the course of a year.\nCDC logo\nGet vaccinated.\nwww.cdc.gov/flu \u200b\nReferences\n\nKostova D, Reed C, Finelli L, Cheng PY, Gargiullo PM, Shay DK, et al.

Clinicians may also wish to consult the IDSA antiviral treatment and antiviral chemoprophylaxis recommendationsexternal icon, and the ATS-IDSA Adult CAP Guidelinesexternal icon.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNeed to fill a prescription for flu antivirals?\nexternal iconFind Flu MedicationPriority Groups for Antiviral Treatment of InfluenzaAntiviral treatment is recommended as soon as possible for any patient with suspected or confirmed influenza who:\n\nis hospitalized;\nhas severe, complicated, or progressive illness; or\nis at higher risk for influenza complications.\n\nDecisions about starting antiviral treatment for patients with suspected influenza should not wait for laboratory confirmation of influenza virus infection. Empiric antiviral treatment should be started as soon as possible in the above priority groups.\nClinicians can consider early empiric antiviral treatment of non-high-risk outpatients with suspected influenza [e.g., influenza-like illness (fever with either cough or sore throat)] based upon clinical judgement, if treatment can be initiated within 48 hours of illness onset.\nAntiviral Drug Options\n\nFor hospitalized patients with suspected or confirmed influenza, initiation of antiviral treatment with oral or enterically-administered oseltamivir is recommended as soon as possible.\nFor outpatients with complications or progressive disease and suspected or confirmed influenza (e.g., pneumonia, or exacerbation of underlying chronic medical conditions), initiation of antiviral treatment with oral oseltamivir is recommended as soon as possible.\nFor outpatients with suspected or confirmed uncomplicated influenza, oral oseltamivir, inhaled zanamivir, intravenous peramivir, or oral baloxavir\u00a0may be used for treatment, depending upon approved age groups and contraindications. In one randomized controlled trial, baloxavir had greater efficacy than oseltamivir in adolescents and adults with influenza B virus infection (Ison, 2020external icon).\n\nMoreCo-circulation of Influenza Viruses and SARS-CoV-2During periods of community co-circulation of influenza viruses and SARS-CoV-2, empiric antiviral treatment of influenza is recommended as soon as possible for the following priority groups: a) hospitalized patients with respiratory illness; b) outpatients with severe, complicated, or progressive respiratory illness; and c) outpatients at higher risk for influenza complications who present with any acute respiratory illness symptoms (with or without fever).\n\nInfluenza and COVID-19 have overlapping signs and symptoms. Testing can help distinguish between influenza virus infection and SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, clinicians should not wait for the results of influenza testing (view Table 3), SARS-CoV-2 testing, or multiplex molecular assays that detect influenza A and B viruses and SARS-CoV-2 (view Table 4) to initiate empiric antiviral treatment for influenza in the above priority groups.\nCo-infection with influenza A or B viruses and SARS-CoV-2 can occur and should be considered, particularly in hospitalized patients with severe respiratory disease.\n\nClinicians should be aware that a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result does not preclude influenza virus infection. For hospitalized patients with suspected influenza who are started on empiric antiviral treatment with oseltamivir, use of influenza molecular assays (view Table 3) or multiplex assays that detect both influenza viruses and SARS-CoV-2 (view Table 4) can inform clinical management.\nClinicians should be aware that a positive influenza test result does not preclude SARS-CoV-2 infection. For hospitalized patients with a positive influenza test result, antiviral treatment of influenza with oseltamivir should be started as soon as possible, and clinicians should also follow guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (view community acquired pneumonia treatment guidance for adults: Metlay, 2019external icon) and other respiratory infections, including SARS-CoV-2 infection (view\u00a0NIH COVID-19 treatment guidelinesexternal icon and IDSA COVID-19 treatment guidelinesexternal icon) if clinically indicated, while awaiting SARS-CoV-2 testing results. Oseltamivir does not have in-vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2 (Choy, 2020external icon).\n\n\nClinicians can utilize telemedicine in place of office visits for patients with acute respiratory illness. It may be useful for providers to implement phone triage lines to enable high-risk patients to discuss symptoms over the phone. Please see the Algorithm to Assist in Medical Office Telephone Evaluation of Patients with Possible Influenza.\nPatients at\u00a0higher risk for influenza complications should be advised to call their provider as soon as possible if they have acute respiratory illness symptoms (with or without fever)\u00a0for consideration of infection with influenza A or B viruses (and early antiviral treatment), SARS-CoV-2, and other respiratory pathogens.\nClinicians can consider starting early (\u226448 hours after illness onset) empiric antiviral treatment of non-high-risk outpatients with suspected influenza [e.g., influenza-like illness (fever with either cough or sore throat)], based upon clinical judgement, including without an office visit. SARS-CoV-2 and other etiologies of influenza-like illness should also be considered.\nNational Institutes of Health (NIH) COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines: Influenza and COVID-19 are availableexternal icon.\nClinical algorithms for the testing and treatment of influenza when SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses are circulating are also available.\n\n\nOpen All Close All\n\n\nOverview of Influenza Antiviral Medications\n\n\n\nAntiviral medications with activity against influenza viruses are an important adjunct to influenza vaccine in the control of influenza.\n\nInfluenza antiviral prescription drugs can be used to\u00a0treat\u00a0influenza, and some can be used to\u00a0prevent\u00a0influenza.\nSix licensed prescription influenza antiviral drugs are approved in the United States.\n\nFour influenza antiviral medications approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are recommended for use in the United States during the 2020-2021 influenza season.\n\nThree drugs are chemically related antiviral medications known as neuraminidase inhibitors that block the viral neuraminidase enzyme and have activity against both influenza A and B viruses:\u00a0 oral\u00a0oseltamivir\u00a0phosphate\u00a0(available as a generic version or under the trade name Tamiflu\u00ae), inhaled\u00a0zanamivir\u00a0(trade name Relenza\u00ae), and intravenous\u00a0peramivir\u00a0(trade name Rapivab\u00ae).\nThe fourth drug is oral\u00a0baloxavir marboxil\u00a0(trade name Xofluza\u00ae), which is active against both influenza A and B viruses but has a different mechanism of action than neuraminidase inhibitors.\u00a0 Baloxavir is a cap-dependent endonuclease inhibitor that interferes with viral RNA transcription and blocks virus replication.\nMore information regarding the four recommended antiviral medications is available: Table 1.\n\n\n\n\nAmantadine and rimantadine are antiviral drugs in a class of medications known as adamantanes, which target the M2 ion channel protein of influenza A viruses. Therefore, these medications are active against influenza A viruses, but not influenza B viruses. As in recent past seasons, there continues to be high levels of resistance (>99%) to adamantanes among circulating influenza A(H3N2) and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (\u201c2009 H1N1\u201d) viruses. Therefore, amantadine and rimantadine are not recommended for antiviral treatment or chemoprophylaxis of currently circulating influenza A viruses.\nAntiviral resistance and reduced susceptibility to the neuraminidase inhibitors and to baloxavir among circulating influenza viruses is currently very low, but this can change.\n\nFor weekly surveillance data on susceptibility of circulating influenza viruses to antivirals in the U.S. this season, see the FluView Weekly U.S. Influenza Surveillance Report.\n\n\nInfluenza viruses with reduced susceptibility or resistance to antivirals can occur sporadically or emerge during or after antiviral treatment in some patients (e.g., immunocompromised). Oseltamivir resistance in influenza A(H3N2) and A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses can develop during treatment, particularly in young children (Roosenhoff, 2019external icon; Lina, 2018external icon;), and immunocompromised persons (Memoli, 2014)external icon. Following treatment with baloxavir, emergence of viruses with molecular markers associated with reduced susceptibility to baloxavir has been observed in clinical trials in immunocompetent children and adults, with higher detection among baloxavir-treated pediatric patients aged <12 years compared with adults (Hayden, 2018external icon;\u00a0Omoto, 2018external icon; Hirostu, 2019external icon; Uehara, 2019external icon; Takashita, 2019external icon).\n\nHuman-to-human transmission of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses with an H275Y mutation in viral neuraminidase conferring resistance to oseltamivir has been reported among severely immunocompromised patients in hospital units,\u00a0 (Gooskens, 2009external icon; Chen, 2011external icon;) and in the community (Hibino, 2017external icon; Le, 2008;external icon Hurt, 2011external icon; Hurt, 2012external icon; Takashita, 2013)external icon, but currently appears to be uncommon.\nLimited human-to-human transmission of influenza A(H3N2) virus with reduced susceptibility to baloxavir has been reported sporadically in Japanese children (Takashita, 2019external icon; Takashita 2019external icon; Imai, 2019external icon), but currently appears to be uncommon.\n\n\nClinical trials and observational data show that early antiviral treatment can shorten the duration of fever and illness symptoms, and may reduce the risk of some\u00a0complications from influenza\u00a0(e.g., otitis media in young children, pneumonia, and respiratory failure).\n\nEarly treatment of hospitalized adult influenza patients with oseltamivir has been reported to reduce death in some observational studies.\nIn hospitalized children, early antiviral treatment with oseltamivir has been reported to shorten the duration of hospitalization in observational studies.\nClinical benefit is greatest when antiviral treatment is administered early, especially within 48 hours of influenza illness onset in clinical trials and observational studies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Antiviral Medications Recommended for Treatment and Chemoprophylaxis of Influenza\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.

Although not part of the FDA-approved indications, use of oral oseltamivir for treatment of influenza in infants less than 14 days old, and for chemoprophylaxis in infants 3 months to 1 year, is recommended by the CDC and the American Academy of Pediatrics. If a child is younger than 3 months old, use of oseltamivir for chemoprophylaxis is not recommended unless the situation is judged critical due to limited data in this age group.\n2\u00a0Self-injury or delirium; mainly reported among Japanese pediatric patients.\n3\u00a0Inhaled zanamivir is contraindicated in patients with underlying airways disease such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and those with a history of allergy to lactose or milk protein.\n4\u00a0Intravenous peramivir is approved by the FDA for treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza within 2 days of illness onset in people 2 years and older. Peramivir efficacy is based on clinical trials versus placebo in which the predominant influenza virus type was influenza A; in one trial, a very limited number of subjects infected with influenza B virus were enrolled.\n5 There are no data for use of peramivir for chemoprophylaxis of influenza. On November 23, 2020, FDA approved baloxavir for post-exposure prophylaxis of influenza in persons aged 12 years and older. One study of baloxavir post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) of influenza in household members aged 12 years and older (73% received baloxavir within 24 hours of onset of symptoms in the index household case who received antiviral treatment) reported that the risk of laboratory-confirmed influenza was significantly lower, by 86%, among those who received baloxavir PEP than among those who received placebo (1.9% [7 of 374] vs. 13.6% [51 of 375]; adjusted risk ratio, 0.14; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.06 to 0.30; P<0.001).\n6 Oral baloxavir marboxil is approved by the FDA for treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza within 2 days of illness onset in people 12 years and older who are otherwise healthy, or at high risk of developing influenza-related complications. The safety and efficacy of baloxavir for the treatment of influenza have been established in pediatric patients 12 years and older weighing at least 40 kg.. Baloxavir efficacy for initial FDA approval in October 2018 was based on clinical trials in previously healthy outpatients 12 to 64 years old (Hayden, 2018external icon). Single-dose baloxavir treatment was superior to placebo and had similar clinical efficacy in time to alleviation of symptoms to a 5-day treatment course of oseltamivir. In October 2019, FDA approved an indication for baloxavir treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza within 2 days of illness onset in people 12 years and older at high risk of developing influenza-related complications, based upon the findings of a clinical trial (Ison, 2020external icon; Baloxavir marboxil (Xofluza)\u00a0 pdf icon[package insert]external icon. U.S. Food and Drug Administration website; 2019). In this clinical trial of early initiation of antiviral treatment for uncomplicated influenza in high-risk patients, baloxavir was superior to placebo and had similar overall efficacy to oseltamivir in the time to alleviation of symptoms. For patients with influenza B virus infection, baloxavir significantly reduced the median time to improvement of symptoms compared with oseltamivir by more than 24 hours. However, there are no available data for baloxavir treatment of influenza in pregnant women, immunocompromised people, or in people with severe influenza. There are no available data from clinical trials for baloxavir treatment of hospitalized patients with influenza.\n\n\n\n\nSummary of Influenza Antiviral Treatment Recommendations\n\n\n\n\nAntiviral treatment is recommended as early as possible for any patient with confirmed or suspected influenza who:\n\nis hospitalized;*\nhas severe, complicated, or progressive illness;* or\nis at higher risk for influenza complications.\n\n\n\n*Note: Oral oseltamivir is the recommended antiviral for patients with severe, complicated, or progressive illness who are not hospitalized, and for hospitalized influenza patients.\n\nAntiviral treatment also can be considered for any previously healthy, symptomatic outpatient not at high risk for influenza complications, who is diagnosed with confirmed or suspected influenza, on the basis of clinical judgment, if treatment can be initiated within 48 hours of illness onset.\n\nFigure: Guide for considering influenza testing and treatment when influenza viruses are circulating in the community (regardless of influenza vaccination history)1\n\nComplete footnotes for this algorithm are available.\n\nClinical judgment, on the basis of the patient\u2019s disease severity and progression, age, underlying medical conditions, likelihood of influenza, and time since onset of symptoms, is important when making antiviral treatment decisions for high-risk outpatients.\nWhen indicated, antiviral treatment should be started as soon as possible after illness onset, ideally within 48 hours of symptom onset. However, antiviral treatment might have some benefits in patients with severe, complicated or progressive illness, and in hospitalized patients when started after 48 hours of illness onset.\n\nObservational studies in hospitalized patients with influenza have reported that clinical benefit is greatest when oseltamivir is started within 48 hours of illness onset (Hsu, 2012external icon; Louie, 2013external icon; Muthuri, 2013external icon; Muthuri, 2014external icon). However, some studies suggest that antiviral treatment might still be beneficial in hospitalized patients when started up to 4 or 5 days after illness onset (Louie, 2012external icon; Yu, 2011external icon). Antiviral treatment of pregnant women (of any trimester) with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection has been shown to be most beneficial in preventing respiratory failure and death when started within less than 3 days of illness onset, but still provided benefit when started 3\u20134 days after onset compared to 5 or more days (Siston, 2010external icon).\u00a0One observational study reported that initiating neuraminidase inhibitor treatment within 6 hours after hospital admission was associated with shorter duration of hospitalization versus starting antiviral treatment later (Katzen, 2018external icon). Another observational study reported that neuraminidase inhibitor treatment initiated at the time of hospitalization was associated with a significant reduction in hospital length of stay in patients with clinically suspected or laboratory-confirmed influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection compared with later initiation or no NAI treatment (Venkatesan, 2019external icon).\n\n\nDecisions about starting antiviral treatment should not wait for laboratory confirmation of influenza (see resources regarding Clinical Description and Lab Diagnosis of Influenza\u00a0for more information on influenza diagnostic testing).\n\nClinical benefit is greatest when antiviral treatment is started as close to illness onset as possible.\n\n\nWhile influenza vaccination is the best way to prevent influenza illness, a history of influenza vaccination does not rule out the possibility of influenza virus infection in an ill patient with clinical signs and symptoms compatible with influenza.\nAntiviral treatment also can be considered for any previously healthy, symptomatic outpatient not at high risk with confirmed or suspected influenza on the basis of clinical judgment, if treatment can be initiated within 48 hours of illness onset. Multiple randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses of RCTs have demonstrated efficacy of early initiation of treatment (started within 48 hours of illness onset) with neuraminidase inhibitors in reducing duration of fever and illness symptoms compared with placebo in otherwise healthy children and adults with uncomplicated influenza (Hayden, 1997external icon;\u00a0Monto, 1999external icon;\u00a0Monto, 1999external icon;\u00a0Nicholson, 2000external icon;\u00a0Hedrick, 2000external icon;\u00a0Treanor, 2000external icon;\u00a0Whitley, 2001external icon;\u00a0Heinonen, 2010external icon;\u00a0Fry, 2014external icon;\u00a0Whitley, 2015external icon;\u00a0Kohno, 2010external icon;\u00a0Hsu, 2012external icon;\u00a0Jefferson, 2014external icon;\u00a0Whitley, 2015external icon;,\u00a0Dobson, 2015external icon;\u00a0Malosh, 2017external icon).\n\nOne randomized clinical trial in children with uncomplicated influenza demonstrated a modest reduction in duration of symptoms and influenza virus shedding in patients initiating treatment after 48 hours; post hoc analysis suggested that oseltamivir treatment initiated 72 hours after illness onset reduced symptoms by one day compared with placebo (Fry, 2014external icon).\n\n\nFor outpatients with acute uncomplicated influenza, oral oseltamivir, inhaled zanamivir, intravenous peramivir, or oral baloxavir may be used for treatment.\n\nThe recommended treatment course for uncomplicated influenza is two doses per day of oral oseltamivir or inhaled zanamivir for 5 days, or one dose of intravenous peramivir or oral baloxavir for 1 day.\nOnly one randomized clinical trial has compared baloxavir to oseltamivir for treatment of influenza B. This study found that baloxavir treatment was superior to oseltamivir among outpatients with influenza B virus infection (Ison, 2020external icon).\nCDC does not recommend use of baloxavir for treatment of influenza in pregnant women or breastfeeding mothers. There are no available efficacy or safety data for baloxavir in pregnant women, and there are no available data on the presence of baloxavir in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production.\nCDC does not recommend use of baloxavir for monotherapy of influenza in severely immunosuppressed persons. There are no available efficacy, safety, or resistance data for baloxavir monotherapy of influenza\u00a0in severely immunosuppressed patients and emergence of resistance during treatment is a concern because of prolonged influenza viral replication in these patients.\nThere are no available data on the use of baloxavir for treatment of influenza more than 2 days after illness onset.\n\n\nOral oseltamivir is preferred for treatment of pregnant women (Rasmussenexternal icon,; 2011external icon). Pregnant women are recommended to receive the same antiviral dosing as non-pregnant people. Multiple recent studies have reported safe use of neuraminidase inhibitors during pregnancy (Dunstan, 2014external icon;\u00a0Xie, 2013external icon;\u00a0Saito, 2013external icon;\u00a0Wollenhaupt, 2014external icon;\u00a0Beau, 2014external icon;\u00a0Svensson, 2011external icon;\u00a0Greer, 2010external icon;\u00a0Graner, 2017external icon);\u00a0Ehrenstien, 2018external icon;\u00a0Chambers, 2019external icon; Bennekom, 2019external icon; ACOG Committee, 2018external icon). See Recommendations for Obstetric Health Care Providers Related to Use of Antiviral Medications in the Treatment and Prevention of Influenza\u00a0for additional information. Baloxavir is not recommended for the treatment of influenza in pregnant women, as there are no available efficacy or safety data for baloxavir in this population.\nFor patients with severe or complicated illness with suspected or confirmed influenza (e.g., pneumonia, or exacerbation of underlying chronic medical condition) who are not hospitalized, antiviral treatment with oral or enterically-administered oseltamivir is recommended as soon as possible.\u00a0There are insufficient data for inhaled zanamivir and intravenous peramivir in patients with severe influenza disease. There are no available data from clinical trials on use of baloxavir treatment in patients with severe influenza disease.\n\n\n\n\nPeople at Higher risk for Influenza Complications Recommended for Antiviral Treatment\n\n\n\n\nchildren younger than 2 years;1\nadults 65 years and older;\npeople with chronic pulmonary (including asthma), cardiovascular (except hypertension alone), renal, hepatic, hematological (including sickle cell disease), and metabolic disorders (including diabetes mellitus), or neurologic and neurodevelopment conditions (including disorders of the brain, spinal cord, peripheral nerve, and muscle, such as cerebral palsy, epilepsy [seizure disorders], stroke, intellectual disability, moderate to severe developmental delay, muscular dystrophy, or spinal cord injury);\npeople with immunosuppression, including that caused by medications or by HIV infection;\nwomen who are pregnant or postpartum (within 2 weeks after delivery);\npeople younger than 19 years old who are receiving long-term aspirin- or salicylate-containing medications\nAmerican Indians/Alaska Natives;\npeople who are extremely obese (i.e., body mass index is equal to or greater than 40); and\nresidents of nursing homes and other chronic care facilities.\n\n1 Although all children younger than 5 years old are considered at higher risk for complications from influenza, the highest risk is for those younger than 2 years old, with the highest hospitalization and death rates among infants younger than 6 months old. Because many children with mild febrile respiratory illness might have other viral infections (e.g., respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus, or human metapneumovirus), knowledge of other respiratory viruses as well as influenza virus strains circulating in the community is important for treatment decisions.\n\n\n\nTreatment Considerations for Patients Hospitalized with Suspected or Confirmed Influenza\n\n\n\nTreatment of patients with severe influenza (e.g., those requiring hospitalization) presents multiple challenges. The effect of specific antiviral strategies in serious or life-threatening influenza is not established from clinical trials conducted to support licensure of oral oseltamivir, inhaled zanamivir, intravenous peramivir, or oral baloxavir, as those studies were conducted primarily among previously healthy outpatients with uncomplicated illness. No randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials have been conducted of neuraminidase inhibitors for treatment of influenza in hospitalized patients. However, a number of observational studies in hospitalized influenza patients have shown clinical benefit of neuraminidase inhibitor antiviral treatment compared with no treatment, particularly when started within two days of influenza illness, including reducing the duration of hospitalization or risk of death (Hiba, 2011external icon;\u00a0Coffin, 2011external icon;\u00a0Hsu, 2012external icon;\u00a0Louie, 2013external icon;\u00a0Muthuri, 2013external icon; Muthuri, 2014external icon; Miyakawa, 2019external icon; Lytras, 2019external icon; Katzen, 2019;external icon Reacher, 2019external icon).\u00a0 In addition, some observational studies have reported that oral oseltamivir treatment started 4 and 5 days after illness onset in \u00a0patients hospitalized with suspected or confirmed influenza was \u00a0associated with lower risk for severe outcomes (EH Lee, 2010external icon;\u00a0N Lee, 2008external icon;\u00a0N Lee, 2010external icon;\u00a0Louie, 2012external icon;\u00a0McGeer, 2007external icon;\u00a0Siston, 2010external icon), although one report found this benefit only in hospitalized adult patients in the ICU (Muthuri, 2014external icon). A small number of observational studies and one meta-analysis of observational studies of hospitalized influenza patients reported that neuraminidase inhibitor treatment did not have survival benefit (Choi, 2017external icon;\u00a0Wolkewitz, 2016external icon;\u00a0Heneghan, 2016external icon).\nThe following recommendations do not necessarily represent FDA-approved uses of antiviral products but are based on published observational studies and expert opinion and are subject to change as the developmental status of investigational products and the epidemiologic and virologic features of influenza change over time.\n\nFor hospitalized patients with suspected or confirmed influenza, initiation of antiviral treatment with oral or enterically-administered oseltamivir is recommended as soon as possible.\u00a0Antiviral treatment might be effective in reducing morbidity and mortality in hospitalized influenza patients, especially adults, even if treatment is started more than 48 hours after onset of illness.\nInhaled zanamivir and oral baloxavir are not recommended because of the lack of data in hospitalized influenza patients. There are also insufficient data for treatment of hospitalized influenza patients with intravenous peramivir. A\u00a0randomized clinical trialexternal icon of baloxavir treatment of influenza in hospitalized patients aged 12 years and older is in-progress.\nFor patients with lower respiratory tract disease, lower respiratory tract specimens, such as bronchoalveolar lavage fluid or endotracheal aspirates, are preferred; an oropharyngeal (throat) swab may be collected if lower respiratory specimens are not available. Testing of lower respiratory tract specimens may detect influenza viruses when testing of upper respiratory tract specimens is negative. Multiple respiratory tract specimens collected on different days should be tested if influenza virus infection is suspected but a definitive diagnosis has not been made.\nThe optimal duration and dosing of antiviral treatment are uncertain for severe or complicated influenza. Treatment regimens might need to be altered to fit the clinical circumstances. For example, clinical judgment should be the guide regarding the need to extend daily treatment regimens longer than 5 days for patients whose illness is prolonged. Critically ill patients with respiratory failure can have prolonged influenza viral replication in the lower respiratory tract and might benefit from longer duration of treatment.\n\nClinical judgment and virologic testing of lower respiratory tract specimens by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) should guide decisions to consider treatment regimens longer than 5 days for hospitalized influenza patients with severe and prolonged illness.\nLonger treatment regimens might be necessary in immunosuppressed people who may have prolonged influenza viral replication. Such patients are at risk of emergence of influenza viruses with reduced susceptibility or antiviral resistance during or after antiviral treatment.\nA higher dose of oral or enterically-administered oseltamivir has been recommended by some experts (e.g., 150 mg twice daily in adults with normal renal function) for treatment of influenza in immunocompromised patients and in severely ill hospitalized patients. However, oral or enterically administered oseltamivir has been reported to be adequately absorbed in critically ill adults, with standard doses producing therapeutic blood levels (Ariano, 2010external icon), and available data suggest that higher dosing may not provide additional clinical benefit (Abdel-Ghafar, 2008external icon;\u00a0Ariano, 2010external icon;\u00a0Kumar, 2010external icon;\u00a0Lee, 2013external icon;\u00a0South East Asia Infectious Disease Clinical Research Network, 2013external icon). Studies indicate that the exposure to oseltamivir carboxylate (the active metabolite of oseltamivir) is similar between obese and non-obese subjects for both 75 mg and 150 mg doses given twice daily (Ariano, 2010external icon;\u00a0Jittamala, 2014external icon;\u00a0Pai, 2011external icon;\u00a0Thorne-Humphrey, 2011external icon).\n\n\nLimited data suggest that oseltamivir administered orally or by oro/naso gastric tube is well absorbed in critically ill influenza patients, including those receiving continuous renal replacement therapy, and/or on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (Ariano, 2010external icon;\u00a0Eyler, 2012aexternal icon;\u00a0Eyler, 2012bexternal icon;\u00a0Giraud, 2011external icon;\u00a0Kromdijk, 2013external icon;\u00a0Lemaitre, 2012external icon;\u00a0Mulla, 2013external icon;\u00a0Taylor, 2008external icon).\nFor patients who cannot tolerate or absorb oral or enterically-administered oseltamivir because of suspected or known gastric stasis, malabsorption, or gastrointestinal bleeding, the use of intravenous peramivir should be considered (Lee, 2017external icon;\u00a0deJong, 2014external icon;\u00a0Ison, 2014external icon;\u00a0Ison, 2013external icon).\n\nIn a randomized trial of treatment of influenza in hospitalized patients >6 years old, a significant clinical benefit was not demonstrated for intravenous peramivir at a dosage of 600 mg once daily (10 mg/kg once daily in children) for five days plus standard of care compared with placebo plus standard of care; however, peramivir was generally safe and well tolerated (de Jong, 2014external icon)\n\n\nIt is possible that some influenza viruses may become less susceptible or resistant to oseltamivir and peramivir during antiviral treatment with one of these drugs and remain susceptible to zanamivir; this has been reported most often for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses (Graitcer, 2011; Lackenby, 2011; Memoli, 2010; Nguyen, 2010; Nguyen, 2012) Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses have also emerged that are resistant to all neuraminidase inhibitors, including zanamivir, in highly immunosuppressed patients on prolonged neuraminidase inhibitor treatment (Tamura, 2015external icon;\u00a0L\u2019Huillier, 2015external icon). Resistance and reduced susceptibility of influenza viruses to antiviral drugs can also occur spontaneously, with no known exposure to antiviral medications (Hurt, 2011external icon;\u00a0Takashita, 2013external icon;\u00a0Takashita, 2014external icon).\nIf a hospitalized patient treated with oseltamivir or peramivir manifests progressive lower respiratory symptoms, resistant virus should be considered. However, clinicians should note that failure to improve or clinical deterioration during oseltamivir or peramivir treatment is more likely to be related to the natural history of acute lung injury and inflammatory damage or onset of other complications (e.g., renal failure, septic shock, ventilator-associated pneumonia) than to emergence of oseltamivir or peramivir resistance. Severely immunosuppressed people (e.g., hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients) are at highest risk for emergence of oseltamivir- and peramivir-resistant influenza virus infection during or following oseltamivir and/or peramivir treatment (Hurt, 2012external icon;\u00a0Memoli, 2010external icon). Molecular analyses can detect genetic changes in influenza viruses associated with resistance and reduced susceptibility to oseltamivir and peramivir. The CDC Influenza Division is available for consultation regarding antiviral susceptibility testing as needed. Information about neuraminidase inhibitor susceptibility testing and interpretation of results of neuraminidase inhibition assays is available on the\u00a0WHO websiteexternal icon.\nIntravenous zanamivir is an investigational parenterally administered neuraminidase inhibitor product that has been available in the past through enrollment in a clinical trial or under an emergency investigational new drug (EIND) request to the manufacturer. However, since the 2017-18 season, intravenous zanamivir is no longer available in the United States.\nCareful attention to ventilator and fluid management and to the prevention and treatment of secondary bacterial pneumonia (e.g.,\u00a0S. pneumoniae,\u00a0S. pyogenes, and\u00a0S. aureus, including MRSA) also is critical for severely ill patients (Bautista, 2010external icon;\u00a0Finelli, 2008external icon;\u00a0Hageman, 2006external icon;\u00a0Harper, 2009pdf iconexternal icon;\u00a0Mandell, 2007external icon;\u00a0Mauad, 2010external icon;\u00a0Shieh, 2010external icon).\n\n\n\n\nTable 2.

Although not part of the FDA-approved indications, use of oral oseltamivir for treatment of influenza in infants less than 14 days old, and for chemoprophylaxis in infants 3 months to 1 year of age, is recommended by the CDC and the American Academy of Pediatrics (Committee on Infectious Diseases, 2018external icon).\n3This is the FDA-approved oral oseltamivir treatment dose for infants 14 days and older and less than 1 year old, and provides oseltamivir exposure in children similar to that achieved by the approved dose of 75 mg orally twice daily for adults, as shown in two studies of oseltamivir pharmacokinetics in children (Kimberlin, 2013 [CASG 114], EU study WP22849, FDA Clinical Pharmacology Reviewexternal icon). The American Academy of Pediatrics has recommended an oseltamivir treatment dose of 3.5 mg/kg orally twice daily for infants 9-11 months old, on the basis of data which indicated that a higher dose of 3.5 mg/kg was needed to achieve the protocol-defined targeted exposure for this cohort as defined in the CASG 114 study (Kimberlin, 2013external icon). It is unknown whether this higher dose will improve efficacy or prevent the development of antiviral resistance. However, there is no evidence that the 3.5 mg/kg dose is harmful or causes more adverse events to infants in this age group.\n4Current weight-based dosing recommendations are not appropriate for premature infants. Premature infants might have slower clearance of oral oseltamivir because of immature renal function, and doses recommended for full-term infants might lead to very high drug concentrations in this age group. CDC recommends dosing as also recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics (Committee on Infectious Diseases, 2018external icon): limited data from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Collaborative Antiviral Study Group provide the basis for dosing preterm infants using their postmenstrual age (gestational age + chronological age): 1.0 mg/kg/dose, orally, twice daily, for those <38 weeks postmenstrual age; 1.5 mg/kg/dose, orally, twice daily, for those 38 through 40 weeks postmenstrual age; 3.0 mg/kg/dose, orally, twice daily, for those >40 weeks postmenstrual age.\n5See Special Considerations for Institutional Settings section below for details regarding duration of chemoprophylaxis for outbreaks in institutional settings.\n6Inhaled zanamivir is approved for treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza within 2 days of illness onset with twice-daily dosing in people 7 years and older, and for chemoprophylaxis with once-daily dosing in people 5 years and older.\n7Intravenous peramivir is approved for treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza within 2 days of illness onset with a single dose in people 2 years and older. Daily dosing for a minimum of 5 days was used in clinical trials of hospitalized patients with influenza (de Jong, 2014external icon, Ison, 2014external icon).\n8There are no data for use of peramivir for chemoprophylaxis of influenza. One study of baloxavir post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) of influenza in household members aged 12 years and older (73% received baloxavir within 24 hours of onset of symptoms in the index household case who received antiviral treatment) reported that the risk of laboratory-confirmed influenza was significantly lower, by 86%, among those who received baloxavir PEP than among those who received placebo (1.9% [7 of 374] vs. 13.6% [51 of 375]; adjusted risk ratio, 0.14; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.06 to 0.30; P<0.001) (Ikematsu, 2020external icon).\n9Oral baloxavir marboxil is approved by the FDA for treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza within 2 days of illness onset in people 12 years and older who are otherwise healthy, or at high risk of developing influenza-related complications.\u00a0 (Baloxavir marboxil (Xofluza)\u00a0pdf icon[package insert]external icon. U.S. Food and Drug Administration website; 2019). Baloxavir marboxil should not be administered with dairy products, calcium-fortified beverages, polyvalent cation-containing laxatives, antacids or oral supplements (e.g., calcium, iron, magnesium, selenium, or zinc); co-administration with polyvalent cation-containing products may decrease plasma concentrations of baloxavir which may reduce efficacy. There are no available published data from clinical trials for baloxavir treatment of influenza in patients who are pregnant, immunocompromised, have severe disease, or in hospitalized patients. A randomized clinical trialexternal icon\u00a0of baloxavir treatment of influenza in hospitalized patients 12 years and older is in-progress.\n\n\n\n\nDuration of Treatment or Chemoprophylaxis\n\n\n\n\nTreatment:\u00a0Recommended duration for antiviral treatment is 5 days for oral oseltamivir or inhaled zanamivir. For the treatment of uncomplicated influenza with intravenous peramivir or oral baloxavir, a single dose is recommended. Longer daily dosing (oral oseltamivir or intravenous peramivir) can be considered for patients who remain severely ill after 5 days of treatment.\nChemoprophylaxis: Recommended duration is 7 days (after last known exposure). For control of outbreaks in institutional settings (e.g., long-term care facilities for elderly people and children) and hospitals, CDC recommends antiviral chemoprophylaxis with oral oseltamivir or inhaled zanamivir for a minimum of 2 weeks and continuing up to 1 week after the last known case was identified. Antiviral chemoprophylaxis is recommended for all residents, including those who have received influenza vaccination. Baloxavir is approved for post-exposure prophylaxis (single-dose) of influenza in persons aged 12 years and older.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nChemoprophylaxis\n\n\n\n\nAnnual influenza vaccinationpdf icon is the best way to prevent influenza because vaccination can be given well before influenza virus exposures occur and can provide safe and effective immunity throughout the influenza season.\nNeuraminidase inhibitor antiviral medications are approximately\u00a070%\u00a0to\u00a090%\u00a0effective in preventing influenza against susceptible influenza viruses and are useful adjuncts to influenza vaccination.\nCDC does not recommend widespread or routine use of antiviral medications for chemoprophylaxis except as one of multiple interventions to control institutional influenza outbreaks. Routine use of post-exposure chemoprophylaxis is not recommended; one reason for this is to avoid sub-therapeutic treatment dosing if infection is already established, although the likelihood of emergence of antiviral resistant viruses is unknown.\n\nClinicians may wish to also consult the antiviral chemoprophylaxis recommendations from the Infectious Diseases Society of America (Uyeki, 2019external icon).\n\n\nIn general, CDC does not recommend seasonal or pre-exposure antiviral chemoprophylaxis, but\u00a0antiviral medications can be considered for chemoprophylaxis to prevent influenza in certain situations, such as the following examples:\n\nPrevention of influenza in people at high risk of influenza complications during the first two weeks following vaccination after exposure to a person with influenza.\nPrevention for people at high risk for complications from influenza who cannot receive influenza vaccine due to a contraindication after exposure to a person with influenza.\nPrevention for people with severe immune deficiencies or others who might not respond to influenza vaccination, such as people receiving immunosuppressive medications, after exposure to a person with influenza.\nPatients receiving antiviral chemoprophylaxis should be encouraged to seek medical evaluation as soon as they develop a febrile respiratory illness that might indicate influenza.\n\n\nAn emphasis on close monitoring and early initiation of antiviral treatment if fever and/or respiratory symptoms develop is an alternative to chemoprophylaxis after a suspected exposure for some people.\nTo be effective as chemoprophylaxis, an antiviral medication must be taken each day for the duration of potential exposure to a person with influenza and continued for 7 days after the last known exposure. For people taking antiviral chemoprophylaxis after inactivated influenza vaccination, the recommended duration is until immunity after vaccination develops (antibody development after vaccination takes about two weeks in adults and can take longer in children depending on age and vaccination history).\nAntiviral chemoprophylaxis generally is not recommended if more than 48 hours have elapsed since the first exposure to a person with influenza.\nPatients receiving antiviral chemoprophylaxis should be encouraged to seek medical evaluation as soon as they develop a febrile respiratory illness that might indicate influenza.\n\n\n\n\nDosing in Adult Patients with Renal Impairment\n\n\n\nDose adjustment of oseltamivir is recommended for patients with creatinine clearance between 10 and 60 mL/min and patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) undergoing hemodialysis or continuous peritoneal dialysis receiving oseltamivir for the treatment or chemoprophylaxis of influenza. Oseltamivir is not recommended for patients with ESRD not undergoing dialysis. The recommended doses are detailed in Table 3; duration of treatment and chemoprophylaxis is the same as recommended for patients with normal renal function. The dose of intravenous peramivir should be reduced for patients with baseline creatinine clearance below 50 mL/min (see Table 3).\nNo dose adjustment is recommended for inhaled zanamivir for a 5-day course of treatment for patients with renal impairment. Pharmacokinetic analysis did not identify a clinically meaningful effect of renal function on the pharmacokinetics of baloxavir in patients with creatinine clearance 50 mL/min and above. The effects of severe renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of baloxavir marboxil or its active metabolite, baloxavir, have not been evaluated.\n\n\n\nTable 3.

Treatment can be initiated immediately if influenza symptoms develop during the 48 hours between hemodialysis sessions; however, the post-hemodialysis dose should still be administered independently of time of administration of the initial dose.\n3\u00a0An initial dose can be administered prior to the start of dialysis.\n4\u00a0Data derived from studies in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients.\n5\u00a0Renal dosing from peramivir package insertexternal icon\u00a0is available for pediatric patients: Creatinine clearance \u226550 mL/min: 12 mg/kg (up to maximum dose of 600 mg); Creatinine clearance 30 to 49 mL/min: 4 mg/kg; Creatinine clearance 10 to 29 mL/min: 2 mg/kg.\n\n\n\nAdverse Events\n\n\n\n\nWhen considering use of influenza antiviral medications, clinicians must consider the patient\u2019s age, weight and renal function; presence of other medical conditions; indications for use (i.e., chemoprophylaxis or therapy); and the potential for interaction with other medications.\nRCTs and meta-analyses of RCTs have indicated that gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea and vomiting are increased with oral oseltamivir compared with placebo; these adverse events may be less likely when oseltamivir is taken with food (Aoki, 2003external icon).\nFor more information on safety, effectiveness and dosing for oral oseltamivir, inhaled zanamivir, intravenous peramivir, or oral baloxavir, visit\u00a0Antiviral Drugs\u00a0or consult the package inserts.\n\n\n\n\nDrug Interactions\n\n\n\n\nCo-administration of baloxavir with polyvalent cation-containing products may decrease plasma concentrations of baloxavir which may reduce efficacy. Avoid co-administration of baloxavir with polyvalent cation-containing laxatives, antacids, or oral supplements (e.g., calcium, iron, magnesium, selenium, or zinc).\nConcurrent administration of antiviral drugs with intranasal live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) may inhibit viral replication of LAIV and thereby decrease the effectiveness of LAIV vaccination. LAIV should not be given if oseltamivir or zanamivir was administered within 48 hours of planned vaccination, or if peramivir was administered within 5 days of planned vaccination, or if baloxavir was administered within 17 days of planned vaccination. If LAIV is given, and antiviral medications are subsequently administered up to two weeks after vaccination, the effectiveness of LAIV might be reduced, and persons who receive these antiviral medications within two weeks after receiving LAIV should be revaccinated with another appropriate influenza vaccine (e.g., IIV or RIV4).\n\nFor more information, visit the\u00a0Seasonal Influenza (Flu)\u00a0site, email\u00a0CDC-INFO, or call CDC at 800-CDC-INFO (English and Spanish) or 888-232-6348 (TTY).\n\nTop of PageResourcesDiagnostic Testing for InfluenzaMore information for clinicians on influenza diagnostic testing is available.\nMoreInformation on Influenza ActivityClinicians should contact their local or state health department for information about current local influenza activity.\u00a0CDC\u2019s FluView report gives Information regarding national influenza activity weekly during influenza season.\nMoreReferencesA more complete list of influenza antiviral references is available.\nMore", "reports": [{"diseases": ["sars", "COVID-19"], "syndromes": ["Influenza-like illness"], "event_date": "2009-03-23 00:00:00", "locations": [null, 10420330, 6255150, 3426543, 11139890, 4634482, 6251796, 2759197]}]}{"url": "https://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/diagnosis/table-flu-covid19-detection.html", "date_of_publication": "", "headline": "Table 4.

The composition of U.S. flu vaccines is reviewed annually and updated as needed to match circulating flu viruses. Flu vaccines protect against the three or four viruses (depending on the vaccine) that research suggests will be most common.\nFor 2020-2021, trivalent (three-component) egg-based vaccines are recommended to contain:\n\nA/Guangdong-Maonan/SWL1536/2019 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus (updated)\nA/Hong Kong/2671/2019 (H3N2)-like virus (updated)\nB/Washington/02/2019 (B/Victoria lineage)-like virus (updated)\n\nQuadrivalent (four-component) egg-based vaccines, which protect against a second lineage of B viruses, are recommended to contain:\n\nthe three recommended viruses above, plus B/Phuket/3073/2013-like (Yamagata lineage) virus.\n\nFor 2020-2021, cell- or recombinant-based vaccines are recommended to contain:\n\nA/Hawaii/70/2019 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus (updated)\nA/Hong Kong/45/2019 (H3N2)-like virus (updated)\nB/Washington/02/2019 (B/Victoria lineage)-like virus (updated)\nB/Phuket/3073/2013-like (Yamagata lineage) virus\n\n Are there any changes to the 2020-2021 Northern Hemisphere vaccines from what was included in this season\u2019s 2019-2020 U.S. flu vaccines?Yes, this season\u2019s flu vaccines were updated to better match viruses expected to be circulating in the United States.\n\nThe egg-based H1N1 vaccine component was updated from an A/Brisbane/02/2018 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus to an A/Guangdong-Maonan/SWL1536/2019 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus.\nThe cell- or recombinant-based H1N1 vaccine component was updated from an A/Brisbane/02/2018 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus to an A/Hawaii/70/2019 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus.\nThe egg-based H3N2 vaccine component was updated from an A/Kansas/14/2017 (H3N2)-like virus to an A/Hong Kong/2671/2019 (H3N2)-like virus.\nThe cell- or recombinant-based H3N2 vaccine component was updated from an A/Kansas/14/2017 (H3N2)-like virus to an A/Hong Kong/45/2019 (H3N2)-like virus.\nThe B/Victoria lineage vaccine component was updated from a B/Colorado/06/2017 (B/Victoria lineage)-like virus to a B/Washington/02/2019 (B/Victoria lineage)-like virus.\nThe B/Yamagata lineage vaccine component was not updated.\n\nAre there any new vaccines licensed for use during the 2020-2021 flu season?\nThere are two new vaccines licensed for use during the 2020-2021 flu season.\n\nThe first is a quadrivalent high-dose vaccine licensed for use in adults 65 years and older. This vaccine will replace the previously licensed trivalent high-dose vaccine.\n\nThe second new vaccine that will be available is a quadrivalent adjuvanted vaccine licensed for use in adults 65 years and older.\n\nThis vaccine is similar to the previously licensed trivalent vaccine containing MF59 adjuvant, but it has one additional influenza B component.\n\nMore information about new vaccines available this year. What flu vaccines are recommended this season?For the 2020-2021 flu season, providers may choose to administer any licensed, age-appropriate flu vaccine (IIV, RIV4, or LAIV4) with no preference for any one vaccine over another.\nVaccine options this season include:\n\nStandard dose flu shots.\nHigh-dose shots for people 65 years and older.\nShots made with adjuvant for people 65 years and older.\nShots made with virus grown in cell culture. No eggs are involved in the production of this vaccine.\nShots made using a vaccine production technology (recombinant vaccine) that do not require having a candidate vaccine virus (CVV) sample to produce.\nLive attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV). \u2013 A vaccine made with attenuated (weakened) live virus that is given by nasal spray.\n\n Do we need to get a flu vaccine earlier this year (i.e. July/August)?There is no change in CDC\u2019s recommendation on timing of vaccination this flu season. Getting vaccinated in July or August is too early, especially for older people, because of the likelihood of reduced protection against flu infection later in the flu season. September and October are good times to get vaccinated. However, as long as flu viruses are circulating, vaccination should continue, even in January or later.\nMore information for vaccination timing this year. Will there be changes in how and where flu vaccine is given this fall and winter?How and where people get a flu vaccine may need to change due to the COVID-19 pandemic. CDC works with healthcare providers and state and local health departments to develop contingency plans on how to vaccinate people against flu without increasing their risk of exposure to respiratory germs, like the virus that causes COVID-19, and has released Interim Guidance for Immunization Services During the COVID-19 Pandemic. More information is available in the \u2018Administering Flu Vaccines during the COVID-19 Pandemic\u2019 section below.\nSome settings that usually provide flu vaccine, like workplaces, may not offer vaccination this upcoming season, because of the challenges with maintaining social distancing. For more information on where you can get a flu vaccine, visit\u00a0www.vaccinefinder.orgexternal iconexternal icon. Information on getting a flu vaccine safely this season is available in the \u2018Getting a Flu Vaccine during the COVID-19 Pandemic\u2019 section below. How many flu vaccines are expected to be available for the 2020-2021 flu season?Flu vaccine is produced by private manufacturers, so supply depends on manufacturers. For the 2020-2021 season, manufacturers have projected they will provide as many as 194-198 million doses of flu vaccine, which is more than the 175 million dose record set during the 2019-2020 flu season. Are there delays in the availability of flu vaccine?Currently, influenza vaccine manufacturers are not reporting any significant delays in national flu vaccine supply or distribution this season.\nInfluenza vaccine production and distribution in the US are primarily private sector endeavors. CDC encourages manufacturers and distributors to use a distribution strategy in which providers receive smaller shipments to allow as many providers as possible to begin vaccination activities early in the vaccination season. Ideally, the intervals between shipments are short so that each provider has a continuous supply and can continue vaccinating patients without interruption. While no significant delays have been reported, in some places, robust demand for vaccine and supplies required to support flu vaccination efforts, like needles or syringes, may mean that some providers run out of vaccine or other supplies before their next shipment has arrived. While an allocation system can initially limit the size of individual orders, as supplies become available in increasing numbers, supply is expected to catch up with demand. Additionally, because vaccine manufacturing has been extended to support the production of a record number of flu vaccine doses this year, providers are likely to receive more shipments throughout the season.\nTo make sure your provider has flu vaccine available, call ahead to confirm availability. There also may be other locations in your area that have vaccine available. Use the VaccineFinderexternal icon to find out where to get vaccinated near you.\nCDC will continue to provide weekly updates on total flu vaccine doses distributed throughout the 2020-2021 flu season. Are there enough doses of flu vaccine available for the 2020-2021 flu season?Vaccine manufactures have said that they will produce between 194 and 198 million doses of flu vaccine this season. While this isn\u2019t enough for every person in the U.S. to receive a flu vaccine this season, not everyone chooses to get vaccinated. For example, last season, only about half of Americans chose to get a flu vaccine and, in general, there are many doses of flu vaccine that go unused every season.\nThat said, demand for flu vaccine may be greater this season because of the COVID-19 pandemic. And while it would be unusual, it is possible that all flu vaccines will be used this season. CDC\u2019s goal is for every available dose of flu vaccine to be used to protect people from flu. To make sure your provider has flu vaccine available, call ahead. There also may be other locations in your area that have vaccine available. Use the VaccineFinderexternal icon to find out where to get vaccinated near you.\nCDC will continue to provide weekly updates on total flu vaccine doses distributed throughout the 2020-2021 flu season. What should someone 65 or older do who is having trouble finding high-dose flu vaccine?CDC does not have a preferential recommendation for any flu vaccine over another, and vaccination should not be delayed to wait on a specific vaccine product when another vaccine licensed for use in adults is available.\nThere are several flu vaccine formulations that are approved for use in people 65 and older, including two so-called \u201cenhanced\u201d flu vaccines: the high dose flu vaccine and the adjuvanted flu vaccine. Both vaccines are specifically designed to create a stronger immune response in people aged 65 years and older.\nAnother recent studyexternal icon showed that a vaccine made using recombinant technology can also produce a stronger immune response in adults 65 years and older.\nFor those having trouble locating \u201cenhanced\u201d vaccines licensed for use in people 65 years and older, call providers ahead of time to check availability. There also may be other locations in your area that have vaccine available. Use VaccineFinderexternal icon to find out where to get vaccinated near you.\nHow to locate high-dose and adjuvanted flu vaccine using VaccineFinder:\n\nVisit VaccineFinder.orgexternal icon\nClick \u201cFind Vaccines\u201d\nClick \u201cSelect your vaccines\u201d\nSelect \u201cFlu Shot (65+)\u201d and then click \u201cAdd 1 Vaccine\u201d\nEnter your address or zip code\nClick \u201cSearch For Vaccine\u201d\nChoose a vaccine provider from the list that appears or choose an option from the map.\nCall ahead to confirm availability and then get your flu vaccine from your chosen provider.\n\n What if my vaccine provider doesn't have my preferred flu vaccine?CDC recommends use of any licensed, age-appropriate influenza vaccine during the 2020-2021 influenza season, including inactivated influenza vaccine, high-dose influenza vaccine, adjuvanted influenza vaccine, or recombinant flu vaccine.\nVaccination should not be delayed to wait on a specific vaccine product when another age-appropriate vaccine is available. What should vaccine providers do if they are experiencing problems with purchasing needles for flu vaccination?No widespread needle shortages or supply interruptions have been reported. Adequate supplies are expected to be available to support both the 2020\u20132021 influenza vaccination program and routine vaccination efforts. However, due to high demand for influenza vaccination in some locations, there may be some limited or temporarily unavailable supplies of specific types of needles and needle/syringe sets. CDC has developed a resource guide\u00a0for providers who are experiencing problems with purchasing needles for influenza and routine vaccinations. Flu and COVID-19What is the difference between Influenza (Flu) and COVID-19?Influenza (Flu) and COVID-19 are both contagious respiratory illnesses, but they are caused by different viruses. COVID-19 is caused by infection with a new coronavirus (called SARS-CoV-2) and flu is caused by infection with\u00a0influenza viruses. Because some of the symptoms of flu and COVID-19 are similar, it may be hard to tell the difference between them based on symptoms alone, and testing may be needed to help confirm a diagnosis.\nCOVID-19 seems to spread more easily than flu and causes more serious illnesses in some people. It can also take longer before people show symptoms and people can be contagious for longer.\nWhile more is learned every day, there is still a lot that is unknown about COVID-19 and the virus that causes it. This page\u00a0compares COVID-19 and flu, given the best available information to date.\nTo learn more about COVID-19, visit Coronavirus (COVID-19).\nTo learn more about flu, visit Influenza (Flu). Will there be flu along with COVID-19 in the fall and winter?While it\u2019s not possible to say with certainty what will happen in the fall and winter, CDC believes it\u2019s likely that flu viruses and the virus that causes COVID-19 will both be spreading. In this context, getting a flu vaccine will be more important than ever. CDC recommends that all people 6 months and older get a yearly flu vaccine. Can I have flu and COVID-19 at the same time?Yes. It is possible have flu, as well as other respiratory illnesses, and COVID-19 at the same time. Health experts are still studying how common this can be.\nSome of the symptoms of flu and COVID-19 are similar, making it hard to tell the difference between them based on symptoms alone. Diagnostic testing\u00a0can help determine if you are sick with flu or COVID-19. Is there a test that can detect both flu and COVID-19?Yes. CDC has developed a test that will check for A and B type seasonal flu viruses and SARS CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. This test will be used by U.S. public health laboratories. Testing for these viruses at the same time will give public health officials important information about how flu and COVID-19 are spreading and what prevention steps should be taken. The test will also help public health laboratories save time and testing materials, and to possibly return test results faster.\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has given CDC an Emergency Use Authorizationexternal iconexternal icon\u00a0for this new test. Initial test kits were sent to public health laboratories in early August 2020. CDC will continue to manufacture and distribute these kits.\nMore information for laboratories is available. Will the new test that detects both flu and COVID-19 replace other tests?No. This new test is designed for use at CDC-supported public health laboratories at state and local levels, where it will supplement and streamline surveillance for flu and COVID-19. The use of this specialized test will be focused on public health surveillance efforts and will not replace any COVID-19 tests currently used in commercial laboratories, hospitals, clinics, and other healthcare settings.\nCDC\u2019s first viral test for SARS-CoV-2 (the CDC 2019-nCoV Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel (ER-34)) will still be available for qualified laboratories to order through the International Reagent Resource (IRR)external iconexternal icon. The new multiplex assay\u00a0can also be ordered through the IRR. Check the IRR website for details.\nFor additional questions, please visit: Clinical Questions about COVID-19: Questions and Answers: Testing, Diagnosis, and Notification Is COVID-19 more dangerous than flu?Flu and COVID-19 can both result in serious illness, including illness resulting in hospitalization or death. While there is still much to learn about COVID-19, recent studies show it does seem as if COVID-19 is more deadly than seasonal influenza. Will a flu vaccine protect me against COVID-19?Getting a flu vaccine will not protect against COVID-19, however flu vaccination has many other important benefits. Flu vaccines have been shown to reduce the risk of flu illness, hospitalization and death. Getting a flu vaccine this fall will be more important than ever, not only to reduce your risk from flu but also to help conserve potentially scarce health care resources. Does a flu vaccination increase your risk of getting COVID-19?There is no evidence that getting a flu vaccination increases your risk of getting sick from a coronavirus, like the one that causes COVID-19.\nYou may have heard about a studyexternal iconexternal icon\u00a0published in January 2020 that reported an association between flu vaccination and risk of four commonly circulating seasonal coronaviruses, but not the one that causes COVID-19. This report was later found to be incorrect.\nThe results from that initial study led researchers in Canada to look at their data to see if they could find similar results in their population. The results from Canada\u2019s studyexternal iconexternal icon\u00a0showed that flu vaccination did not increase risk for these seasonal coronaviruses. The Canadian findings highlighted the protective benefits of flu vaccination.\nThe Canadian researchers also identified a flaw in the methods of the first study, noting that it violated the part of study design that compares vaccination rates among patients with and without flu (test negative design). This flaw led to the incorrect association between flu vaccination and seasonal coronavirus risk. When these researchers reexamined data from the first study using correct methods, they found that flu vaccination did not increase risk for infection with other respiratory viruses, including seasonal coronaviruses. What is CDC doing to promote flu vaccination during the COVID-19 pandemic?To address the importance of influenza vaccination, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, CDC will maximize flu vaccination by increasing availability of vaccine, including purchasing an additional 2 million doses of pediatric flu vaccine and 9.3 million doses of adult flu vaccine, by emphasizing the importance of flu vaccination for the entire flu season, and by conducting targeted communication outreach to specific groups who are at higher risk for complications from flu. These same groups are often at higher risk for COVID-19 too, so protecting them from influenza is important to decrease their risk of co-infection. Communication strategies for providers and the public will include:\n\nEducational outreach activities by CDC, including social media, press conferences, web page spotlights, radio media tours, op-eds, and other publications,\nA digital campaign to educate the general public and people with who are at increased risk from influenza and COVID-19 complications,\nSpecial educational efforts to inform the general population, people with underlying health conditions, and African American and Hispanic audiences about the importance of flu vaccination, and\nUpdated vaccination websites for the public and providers that highlight the safety precautions being implemented in healthcare facilities during the pandemic.\n\n If I get sick with flu, am I at higher risk of contracting COVID-19?Because COVID-19 is still a relatively new illness, there is little data on how flu illness affects the risk of getting COVID-19. In general, getting sick with one virus, like flu, doesn\u2019t affect being infected with another, like the virus that causes COVID-19. \u00a0We do know that people can be infected with flu viruses and the virus that causes COVID-19 at the same time. Getting a flu vaccine can reduce your risk of getting flu. Because the symptoms of flu and COVID-19 are similar, how will I know if I have flu or COVID-19?Although there are some differences between flu and COVID-19, they also share signs and symptoms. For this reason, it may be hard to tell the difference between them based on symptoms alone. Testing may be needed to help confirm a diagnosis. Get more information on symptoms of COVID-19 and flu. I think I may have flu. Is it safe for me to visit my health care provider during the COVID-19 pandemic?Providers may have different procedures and practices for evaluating and treating flu during the COVID-19 pandemic. If you have flu symptoms and are at high risk of serious flu complications, you should call your health care provider as soon as possible to tell them about your symptoms. Your provider may decide to treat you with flu antiviral medications. Follow your health care provider\u2019s and CDC\u2019s recommendations for doctor visits. Continue to take everyday preventive actions. Getting a Flu Vaccine during the COVID-19 PandemicIf coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is spreading in my community, should I still go out to get a flu vaccine?Yes. Getting a flu vaccine is an essential part of protecting your health and your family\u2019s health this season. To protect your health when getting a flu vaccine, follow CDC\u2019s recommendations for running essential errands and doctor visits. Continue to take everyday preventive actions. How can I safely get a flu vaccine if COVID-19 is spreading in my community?When going to get a flu vaccine, practice everyday preventive actions and follow CDC recommendations for running essential errands.\nAsk your doctor, pharmacist, or health department if they are following CDC\u2019s vaccination pandemic guidance. Any vaccination location following CDC\u2019s guidance should be a safe place for you to get a flu vaccine. If I am at high risk for serious illness from COVID-19 or flu, where is the safest place for me to get a flu vaccine?You can safely get a flu vaccine at multiple locations including your doctor\u2019s office, health departments, and pharmacies. You can use\u00a0VaccineFinder.orgexternal iconexternal icon\u00a0to find where flu vaccines are available near you. When going to get a flu vaccine, be sure to practice everyday preventive actions.\nAsk your doctor, pharmacist, or health department if they are following CDC\u2019s vaccination pandemic guidance. Any vaccination location following CDC\u2019s guidance should be a safe place for you to get a flu vaccine.\n\n\nVaccination of people at high risk\u00a0for flu complications is especially important to decrease their risk of severe flu illness. Many people at higher risk from flu also seem to be at higher risk from COVID-19. If you are at high risk, it is especially important for you to get a flu vaccine this year.\n\n\n Why do I need a flu vaccine if I am wearing a mask and social distancing?Wearing a mask and social distancing can help protect you and others from respiratory viruses, like flu and COVID-19, but best way to prevent flu illness is for everyone 6 months and older to be vaccinated each year. Flu activity is low in my community right now; should I wait to get a flu vaccine?No, you should not delay getting a flu vaccine. While flu activity may be low in your community now, it could begin increasing at any time. Remember, it takes about two weeks after vaccination to develop antibodies that provide protection against flu. Ideally, you should get vaccinated before flu viruses begin circulating in your community. Everyone 6 months and older should get a flu vaccine each year. Can I get a flu vaccine if I have COVID-19 or if I think I have been exposed to someone with COVID-19?For people who are sick with COVID-19 and who are already in a medical setting (for example, are in a hospital or other health care setting), flu vaccination should be deferred until they are no longer acutely ill.\n\u00a0For those who are sick with COVID-19 or think they might have COVID-19, it is important to stay home and stay away from other people, unless medical care is required. Those who are not in a medical care setting (for example, are isolating at home), should wait until they meet criteria for leaving isolation (even if they have no symptoms) to come to a vaccination setting in order to avoid spreading COVID-19 to others in the vaccination setting. CDC has guidance for when you can be around others after having COVID-19. Are there special precautions my doctor, pharmacist, or health department should take this flu season to make sure flu vaccines can be given safely during the COVID-19 pandemic?Yes. CDC has resources to help with vaccine planning during the COVID-19 pandemic. Ask your doctor, pharmacist, or health department if they are following CDC\u2019s vaccination pandemic guidance. \u00a0And protect yourself by practicing everyday preventive actions. I don\u2019t have a primary care provider, where can I get a flu vaccine?If you don\u2019t have a doctor that you regularly see, flu vaccines are also available at locations including health departments and pharmacies. You can use\u00a0VaccineFinder.orgexternal iconexternal icon\u00a0to find where flu vaccines are available near you. Can I get a COVID-19 vaccine and flu vaccine at the same time?No. You should not get a COVID-19 vaccine and a flu vaccine at the same time. COVID-19 vaccines should be given alone with at least 14 days either before or after you get any other vaccines, including a flu vaccine. This is because there is currently limited information on the safety and effectiveness of getting other vaccines at the same time as a COVID-19 vaccine.\nAs more information becomes available, this recommendation may change. Your healthcare provider can help you decide the best vaccination schedule for you and your family. Flu ActivityWill new flu viruses circulate this season?Flu viruses are constantly changing so it\u2019s not unusual for new flu viruses to appear each year. More information about how flu viruses change\u00a0is available. When will flu activity begin and when will it peak?The timing of flu is difficult to predict and can vary in different parts of the country and from season to season. Are there any updates in the methods for flu surveillance for the upcoming season?For the 2020-2021 flu season, there are some changes to FluView surveillance methodology.\nThis season, in addition to state-level data, the influenza-like-illness (ILI) activity map will display ILI activity by Core-based Statistical Areas (CBSA), a U.S. geographic area defined by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) that consists of one or more counties (or equivalents) anchored by an urban center of at least 10,000 people plus adjacent counties that are socioeconomically tied to the urban center by commuting.\nAlso, during most flu seasons, state and territorial health departments report the level of geographic spread of flu activity in their jurisdictions each week through the\u00a0State and Territorial Epidemiologists Report. However, due to the impact of COVID-19 on ILI surveillance, and the facts that the state and territorial epidemiologists report relies heavily on ILI activity, reporting for this system will be suspended for the 2020-21 influenza season.\nFinally, NCHS collects death certificate data for all deaths occurring in the United States, and these data are aggregated by the week of death occurrence. In previous flu seasons, the NCHS surveillance data were used to calculate the percent of all deaths occurring each week that had pneumonia and/or influenza (P&I) listed as a cause of death. Because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, COVID-19 coded deaths were added to P&I to create the PIC (pneumonia, influenza, and/or COVID-19) classification. PIC includes all deaths with pneumonia, influenza, and/or COVID-19 listed on the death certificate.\nMore information on flu surveillance methodology and these updates is available online. Flu Vaccine CoverageWhat vaccine uptake estimates will CDC provide this season?CDC has developed a new Weekly National Influenza Vaccination Dashboard designed to share preliminary, in-season, weekly influenza vaccination coverage estimates and related data.\nThe dashboard will include information on the number of influenza vaccine doses distributed in the United States, weekly flu vaccination coverage rates for children 6 months \u2013 17 years old, monthly flu vaccination coverage rates among pregnant persons, and information on how many flu vaccines have been administered in pharmacies and doctor\u2019s offices.\nThe data will be updated weekly or monthly, depending on the data source, throughout the 2020-2021 influenza season; other data sources will be added as they become available. Visit the National Influenza Vaccination Dashboard for more information.\n\u00a0\nCDC also provides seasonal flu vaccination coverage estimates at the end of a flu season. However, those estimates are not usually available until several months after the flu season ends. How is CDC tracking weekly flu vaccination coverage among children 6 months \u2013 17 years old?Influenza vaccination coverage among children is assessed through the\u00a0National Immunization Survey-Flu\u00a0(NIS-Flu), which provides weekly influenza vaccination coverage estimates for children 6 months\u201317 years old. NIS-Flu is a national random-digit-dialed cellular telephone survey of households conducted during the flu season (October-June). Additional information about NIS-Flu methods and estimates from 2019-2020 season are available at FluVaxView. How is CDC tracking monthly flu vaccination coverage among pregnant women?Monthly flu vaccination coverage estimates among pregnant women are based on electronic health record (EHR) data from the\u00a0Vaccine Safety Datalink\u00a0(VSD), a collaboration between CDC\u2019s Immunization Safety Office and nine integrated health care organizations. Of note, because these estimates are based on data from nine integrated health care systems, they may not be representative of all pregnant women in the U.S. How is CDC tracking the number of flu vaccines administered at pharmacies and doctor\u2019s offices?CDC is tracking the number of flu vaccines administered at pharmacies and doctor\u2019s offices by utilizing new sources of vaccination data, including IQVIAexternal icon\u00a0data for vaccinations administered in retail pharmacies (e.g., \u00a0chain, mass merchandise, food stores, and independent pharmacies) and doctor\u2019s offices. When will the first flu vaccine uptake estimates be provided for this season?CDC will launch the first weekly FluVaxView dashboard in December. The number of flu vaccine doses distributed, vaccination coverage estimates for children, and vaccinations administered in retail pharmacies and doctor\u2019s offices will be updated weekly. Coverage estimates for pregnant women will be updated monthly. Visit the National Influenza Vaccination Dashboard for more information. Is this the same kind of vaccine uptake information that has been provided in the past?Each flu season since 2009-2010, CDC has estimated annual influenza vaccination coverage for the United States by utilizing data from several nationally representative surveys: the\u00a0Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System\u00a0(BRFSS), the\u00a0National Health Interview Survey\u00a0(NHIS), and the\u00a0National Immunization Survey-Flu (NIS-Flu). Internet panel surveys of\u00a0adults,\u00a0health care personnel, and\u00a0pregnant women\u00a0are also used.\nClick here for vaccination coverage estimates from past flu season. CDC will continue to provide end of season estimates of influenza vaccination coverage from these data sources.\n\u00a0\nFor the 2020-21 flu season, CDC will provide weekly updates on the number of flu vaccine doses distributed, vaccination coverage estimates for children, and the number of doses administered in pharmacies and doctor\u2019s offices. Coverage estimates for pregnant women and will be updated monthly. Is CDC working to improve influenza vaccine uptake data?CDC is exploring non-survey data sources, such as claims and other administrative data, to track flu vaccination coverage. \u00a0For example, CDC is exploring ways to estimate within-season influenza vaccination coverage among adults using data on the number of doses administered in pharmacies and doctor\u2019s offices and estimates of the proportion of all influenza vaccinations that are received in these settings.\u00a0 CDC supports state and local jurisdictions in use of their immunization information systems to assess influenza vaccination coverage at the jurisdictional level. Administering Flu Vaccines During the COVID-19 PandemicIs there guidance for safely administering vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic?CDC has released Interim Guidance for Immunization Services During the COVID-19 Pandemic. This guidance is intended to help immunization providers in a variety of clinical and alternative settings with the safe administration of vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic. This guidance will be continually reassessed and updated based on the evolving epidemiology of COVID-19 in the United States. Healthcare providers who give vaccines should also consult guidance from state, local, tribal, and territorial health officials.\nFor the complete interim guidance for immunization services during the COVID-19 pandemic. Why is it important for influenza (flu) vaccines to be given during the COVID-19 pandemic?Efforts to reduce the spread of COVID-19, such as stay-at-home and shelter-in-place orders, have led to decreased use of routine preventive medical services, including immunization services. Ensuring that people continue or start getting routine vaccinations during the COVID-19 pandemic is essential for protecting people and communities from vaccine-preventable diseases and outbreaks, including flu. Routine vaccination prevents illnesses that lead to unnecessary medical visits and hospitalizations, which further strain the healthcare system.\nFor the upcoming flu season, flu vaccination will be very important to reduce flu because it can help reduce the overall impact of respiratory illnesses on the population and thus lessen the resulting burden on the healthcare system during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nA flu vaccine may also provide several individual health benefits, including keeping you from getting sick with flu, reducing the severity of your illness if you do get flu and reducing your risk of a flu-associated hospitalization. Who should get their flu vaccine during the COVID-19 pandemic?Annual flu vaccination is recommended\u00a0for everyone 6 months of age and older, with rare exceptions, because it is an effective way to decrease flu illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, reducing the overall burden of respiratory illnesses is important to protect vulnerable populations at risk for severe illness, the healthcare system, and other critical infrastructure. Thus, healthcare providers should use every opportunity during the influenza vaccination season to administer influenza vaccines to all eligible persons, including;\n\nEssential workers: Including healthcare personnel (including nursing home, long-term care facility, and pharmacy staff) and other critical infrastructure\u00a0workforce\nPersons at increased risk for\u00a0severe illness from COVID-19: Including adults aged 65 years and older, residents in a nursing home or long-term care facility, and persons of all ages with certain underlying medical conditions. Severe illness from COVID-19 has been observed to disproportionately affect members of certain racial/ethnic minority groups\nPersons at increased risk for serious influenza complications: Including infants and young children, children with neurologic conditions, pregnant women, adults aged 65 years and older, and other persons with certain underlying medical conditions\n\n Should a flu vaccine be given to someone with suspected or confirmed COVID-19?No. Vaccination should be deferred (postponed) for people with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, regardless of whether they have symptoms, until they have met the criteria\u00a0to discontinue their isolation. While mild illness is not a contraindication to flu vaccination, vaccination visits for these people should be postponed to avoid exposing healthcare personnel and other patients to the virus that causes COVID-19. When scheduling or confirming appointments for vaccination, patients should be instructed to notify the provider\u2019s office or clinic in advance if they currently have or develop any symptoms of COVID-19.\nAdditionally, a prior infection with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 or flu does not protect someone from future flu infections. The best way to prevent seasonal flu is to get vaccinated every year. What steps can healthcare personnel take to safely give flu vaccine during the COVID-19 pandemic?The potential for asymptomatic spread of the virus that causes COVID-19 underscores the importance of applying infection prevention practices to encounters with all patients, including physical distancing (at least 6 feet) when possible, respiratory and hand hygiene, surface decontamination, and source control while in a healthcare facility. Immunization providers should refer to the guidance developed to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in healthcare settings, including outpatient and ambulatory care settings.\nTo help ensure the safe delivery of care during vaccination visits, providers should:\n\nMinimize chances for exposures, including steps such as these:\n\nScreen patients for symptoms of COVID-19 and contact with persons with possible COVID-19 prior to\u00a0and upon their arrival at the facility, and isolate symptomatic patients as soon as possible.\nLimit and monitor points of entry to the facility and install barriers, such as clear plastic sneeze guards, to limit physical contact with patients at triage.\nImplement policies for adults and children over the age of 2 years to wear cloth face coverings\u00a0(if tolerated).\nEnsure patients practice respiratory hygiene, cough etiquette, and hand hygiene.\n\n\nEnsure all staff adhere to the following infection prevention and control procedures:\n\nFollow Standard Precautions, which include guidance for hand hygiene and cleaning the environment between patients.\nWear a medical facemask at all times.\nUse eye protection based on level of community transmission\u00a0of the virus that causes COVID-19:\n\nModerate-to-substantial transmission: Healthcare providers should wear eye protection given the increased likelihood of encountering asymptomatic COVID-19 patients.\nMinimal-to-no transmission: Universal eye protection is considered optional, unless otherwise indicated as a part of Standard Precautions.\n\n\n\n\nConsider these additional steps during vaccine administration:\n\nIntranasal or oral vaccines:\n\nHealthcare providers should wear gloves when giving intranasal or oral vaccines because of the increased likelihood of coming into contact with a patient\u2019s mucous membranes and body fluids. They should change their gloves and wash their hands between patients.\nGiving these vaccines is not considered an aerosol-generating procedure\u00a0and thus, the use of an N95 or higher-level respirator is not recommended.\n\n\nIntramuscular or subcutaneous vaccines:\n\nIf healthcare providers wear gloves when administering vaccine, they should change their gloves and wash their hands between patients.\n\n\n\n\nFor patients (sick or well) presenting for care or routine visits, ensure physical distancing by implementing strategies, such as:\n\nSeparating sick from well patients by scheduling these visits during different times of the day (e.g., well visits in the morning and sick visits in the afternoon), placing patients with sick visits in different areas of the facility, or scheduling patients with sick visits in a different location from well visits (when space is available).\nReduce crowding in waiting areas by asking patients to remain outside (e.g., stay in their vehicles, if applicable) until they are called into the facility for their appointment.\nEnsure that physical distancing measures, with separation of at least 6 feet between patients and visitors, are maintained during all aspects of the visit, including check-in, checkout, screening procedures, and postvaccination monitoring. Use strategies such as physical barriers, signs, ropes, and floor markings.\nUse electronic communications as much as possible (e.g., filling out needed paperwork online in advance) to minimize patients\u2019 time in the office as well as their sharing of materials (e.g., clipboards, pens).\n\n\n\n Is there guidance for giving flu vaccine in settings other than a doctor\u2019s office (e.g., pharmacies; temporary, off-site, or satellite clinics; and large-scale influenza clinics)?Yes. Guidance has been developed for giving vaccines at pharmacies, temporary, off-site, or satellite clinicspdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon, and large-scale influenza clinics. Other approaches to vaccination during the COVID-19 pandemic may include drive-through immunization services at fixed sites, curbside clinics, mobile outreach units, and home visits.\nThe general principles outlined for healthcare facilities\u00a0should also be applied to alternative vaccination sites, with additional precautions for physical distancing that are particularly relevant for large-scale clinics, such as:\n\nProviding specific appointment times or other strategies to manage patient flow and avoid crowding.\nEnsuring sufficient staff and resources to help move patients through the clinic as quickly as possible.\nLimiting the overall number of patients at any given time, particularly for populations at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.\nSetting up a one-way flow through the site and using signs, ropes, or other measures to direct patient traffic and ensure physical distancing between patients.\nArranging a separate vaccination area or separate hours for persons at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19, such as older adults and persons with underlying medical conditions, when feasible.\nSelecting a space large enough to ensure a minimum distance of 6 feet between patients in line or in waiting areas for vaccination, between vaccination stations, and in postvaccination monitoring areas (the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends that providers consider observing patients for 15 minutes after vaccinationpdf iconpdf icon\u00a0to decrease the risk for injury should they faint).\n\n When can someone who recovered from COVID-19 receive an influenza vaccine?Influenza vaccination should be deferred until a patient is no longer acutely ill. This may be different for patients who are already being cared for in a medical setting than it is for patients who are isolating at home. In a medical setting, the timing for vaccination is a matter of clinical discretion. In the outpatient setting, in general, patients who are isolating at home should wait until they meet criteria for leaving isolation (even if they have no symptoms) to come to a vaccination setting in order to avoid spreading COVID-19 to others in the vaccination setting. CDC has guidance for when you can be around others after having COVID-19. What is CDC\u2019s recommendation regarding drive-through influenza vaccination clinics?Curbside and drive-through vaccination clinics may provide the best option for staff and patient safety during the COVID-19 pandemic. Read CDC\u2019s guidance on drive-through vaccination clinics. Should we test for COVID-19 or perform COVID-19 screening before giving an influenza vaccine?COVID-19 testing prior to administering an influenza vaccine is not necessary. However, people who are sick and are suspected of having COVID-19 but who are not already in a health care facility should not come to a vaccination clinic or a healthcare facility for an influenza vaccination, in order to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 to others. Expanded guidance for influenza vaccination during the COVID-19 pandemic is available online: Additional Considerations for Influenza Vaccination of Persons in Healthcare Facilities and Congregate Settings During the COVID-19 Pandemic. Can COVID-19 and influenza vaccines be co-administered?No. The COVID-19 vaccines should be administered alone, with a minimum interval of 14 days before or after administration of any other vaccines, including influenza vaccines. This is because of a lack of data on safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccine administered simultaneously with other vaccines. If COVID-19 vaccine is inadvertently administered within 14 days of another vaccine, doses do not need to be repeated for either vaccine.\nThis recommendation may be updated as more safety and efficacy data become available. Testing and Treatment of Respiratory Illness when SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza Viruses are Co-circulatingWhat should we do if we have a patient who is sick with influenza/COVID-19-like symptoms while waiting for diagnostic test results?While waiting on results of testing, sick non-hospitalized persons with respiratory symptoms should self-isolate at home. Even if people test negative for both viruses, they should self-isolate because of the potential for false negative testing results \u2013 depending upon what kind of test was done (antigen test, molecular test) and the level of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza transmission\u00a0 in the community. Persons not hospitalized but who are at high-risk for complications from influenza should get antiviral treatment for influenza as soon as possible.\nFor hospitalized patients, empiric oseltamivir treatment for suspected influenza should be started as soon as possible regardless of illness duration, without waiting for influenza testing results. Get more information on testing and treatment when SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses are co-circulating. I have a patient who has influenza/COVID-19-like symptoms, how should I proceed with testing and treatment?CDC has developed clinical algorithms that can help guide decisions for influenza testing and treatment when SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses are co-circulating. Do influenza antiviral medications have any positive or negative impact on a concurrent COVID-19 infection?Influenza antiviral medications have no activity against SARS-CoV-2 viruses, nor do they interact with medications used for treatment of COVID-19 patients. If a patient who is at high risk for serious influenza complications is diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus co-infection, they should receive influenza antiviral treatment. Flu Surveillance Data UpdatesWhy was pneumonia, influenza, and COVID-19 (PIC) mortality data added to FluView Interactive?CDC monitors flu deaths each week using death certificate data collected by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). During previous flu seasons, NCHS mortality surveillance data were used to calculate the percentage of all U.S. deaths occurring each week that had pneumonia and/or influenza (P&I) listed as a cause of death on the death certificate. However, because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, COVID-19 coded deaths were added to P&I to create the PIC (pneumonia, influenza and/or COVID-19) mortality classification. CDC has displayed PIC mortality in its FluView report since week 40 of 2020. However, in order to make these data more easily downloadable and interactive, CDC incorporated PIC mortality data into its FluView Interactive data dashboard, beginning with the release of the Week 6 (week ending February 13, 2021) FluView report. FluView Interactive\u00a0is an online data dashboard that accompanies the FluView report. Using FluView Interactive, users can download flu data and view this data via detailed, interactive graphs, charts, maps, and other visualizations.

Heyman Service to America Medal for Science and Environment. The Sammies are presented by the Partnership for Public Service, a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization whose mission is to help make the U.S. government more effective.\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar presented the award to Jernigan, saying, \u201cMost of us try to stay away from people with contagious illnesses, but not Dr. Daniel Jernigan, he goes towards them. During his 25 years with CDC, he\u2019s travelled to investigate SARS in Taiwan and MERS in Saudi Arabia. He\u2019s also worked on avian flu in China and the Ebola outbreak in West Africa.\u201d\nJernigan started at CDC in 1994 as an Epidemic Intelligence Service officer (sometimes called a \u201cDisease Detective\u201d) working in the Respiratory Diseases Branch at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention where early on he was asked to investigate a Legionella outbreak. Since that first investigation 25 years ago, Jernigan has gone on to take leadership roles in CDC\u2019s responses to dozens of contagious disease outbreaks both in the United States and around the world. Today, as Influenza Division Director, Jernigan oversees more than 300 scientists, public health experts, and other staff. At the awards ceremony on October 16, Jernigan recognized his colleagues, saying: \u201cThis award recognizes the work of many people at CDC and in the Influenza Division who are not afraid to jump into complicated situations and develop creative solutions. For flu, those innovations have contributed to averting thousands of deaths and tens of thousands of hospitalizations each year, avoiding illnesses that did not need to occur.\u201d\nNancy Messonnier, MD, Director of CDC\u2019s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said that Jernigan\u2019s \u201cability to manage and lead through any crisis with intelligence and humor and camaraderie\u201d makes his presence valuable in any global health crises.\nAnne Schuchat, MD, CDC\u2019s Principal Deputy Director, commends his ability to innovate.\u00a0 \u201c[Dr. Jernigan] is able to see very far ahead to where we need to go and find innovative ways to get there, whether it\u2019s reinventing how we characterize flu viruses or making laboratories more efficient and ready to surge when there\u2019s a pandemic or bad flu season,\u201d she said.\nBut whether Jernigan is looking to solve a problem in real time, or one that has yet to happen, it\u2019s the fact that he\u2019s able to do so every day that keeps him at CDC.\n\u201cThe ability to effect change very quickly and having the tools to do it is what makes it worth it,\u201d he said. \u201cPlus, I get to work with incredible people as well.\u201d\nLearn more about the work Dr. Jernigan and the Influenza Division are doing by visiting\u00a0www.cdc.gov/flu.\nTo learn more about the Samuel J.

The 2009 H1N1 pandemic was estimated to be associated with 151,700 to 575,400 deaths worldwide during the first year it circulated. [1] This H1N1 virus has continued to circulate seasonally to this day. CDC and its many partners have made great strides in the fields of influenza surveillance, prevention, and treatment since 2009, benefiting both the annual response to seasonal flu epidemics, as well as the global capacity to respond to the next pandemic.

Once labs had the CDC test kit and verified that their testing was running properly, they were able to process their own specimens and no longer needed lab confirmation from CDC.\nGene sequencing technology\n\nDuring the pandemic, owing in part to the preparedness work done prior to 2009, CDC and public health laboratories were able to use molecular testing technology, \u201cwith its pinpoint accuracy and revolutionary speed\u201d [2] to detect cases, and monitor the spread of the virus and its characteristics, including watching for emerging drug resistance, for example. In the wake of the 2009 pandemic, numerous retrospective analyses deemed the use of this technology to be one of the response\u2019s key successes [3].\nSince the pandemic, CDC\u2019s ability to map the complete influenza virus genome has improved exponentially, thanks to considerable leaps forward in gene sequencing technology, sometimes referred to as Next Generation Sequencing or Advanced Molecular Detection (AMD) technology. Where previous technologies revealed the genes of the predominant influenza virus in a respiratory specimen, it\u2019s now possible to see the gene sequences of all of the influenza particles in a single specimen, thereby giving deeper insight into how influenza viruses may change, for example, by mutating inside a single patient to become resistant to antiviral drugs.\nIn 2012 CDC\u2019s influenza laboratory transitioned from a characterization-first approach to a sequence-first approach so now all flu viruses undergo full sequencing as a first step when they arrive at CDC. This change has reduced public health response time to flu outbreaks and also served to greatly expand the global repositories of influenza gene sequence data. Meanwhile, ongoing technological improvements by device manufacturers and CDC\u2019s innovative protocols have brought the gene sequencing cost per virus down from about $180.00 in 2012 to $25.00 per virus in 2019, with additional improvements in the works to bring the cost down even further.\nIn 2009, CDC sequenced influenza virus genomes primarily for the identification of vaccine reference viruses. Now, CDC performs \u201cnext generation sequencing\u201d on close to 7,000 influenza viruses annually, and has submitted more than 30,000 flu virus genomes to public databases.\nTop of PageInfluenza public health laboratory tests\nRT-PCR \n\nSince 2009, the widespread adoption by public health laboratories of the testing technique called \u201creal-time Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction\u201d (rRT-PCR) with CDC\u2019s flu rRT-PCR test kits has directly enhanced the nation\u2019s pandemic preparedness in a number of ways. For one, widespread use of both has led to standardization of influenza testing across the nation\u2019s public health laboratories. Relative to the other diagnostic methods widely used by laboratories to reveal the type and subtype of flu virus in a sample, rRT-PCR produces more-reliable results, and produces those results faster than most other laboratory techniques. [4]\nCDC\u2019s primary rRT-PCR test for influenza viruses (called the \u2018CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel\u2019) is an internationally recognized reference method for detection of influenza. This means the performance of other detection methods is often measured against the performance of CDC\u2019s rRT-PCR flu test.\nThe adaptability of the rRT-PCR test allows laboratories to quickly adjust how specimens are processed in outbreak and pandemic situations to avoid backlogs and unnecessary use of resources. CDC provides algorithms that help to ensure that as more specimens are tested, reagents are conserved, thereby maximizing their public health benefit and further reducing the possibility of supply shortages.\nAlthough laboratories have the option of using other rRT-PCR tests, use of the CDC test in lieu of commercially manufactured rRT-PCR tests takes the pressure off individual laboratories of ensuring their tests are able to detect the newest emerging viruses.\nCDC uses gene sequence data to update its influenza diagnostic kits and reagents, which are used around the world by public health laboratories as the gold-standard for detecting influenza, in large part because of CDC\u2019s rapid response in updating the kits and reagents each time a novel virus emerges.\nFor example, in 2012 the U.S. experienced a rapid up-tick in human infections with swine influenza viruses (called variant virus infections) associated with exposure to infected pigs. CDC quickly confirmed the CDC rRT-PCR test kit\u2019s ability to detect those swine viruses appearing in people, and then issued\u00a0guidance to laboratories on how to interpret rRT-PCR test results when testing specimens from patients with known pig exposure. Since then, CDC has monitored how the diagnostic kit has performed in detecting variant infections and has updated guidance and virus-specific assay materials (called reagents) to make sure the tests are able to detect these viruses as they have evolved.\nIn April 2013, shortly after the first influenza A(H7N9) human infections in China were reported and within days of China CDC sharing gene sequences of the H7N9 virus, U.S. CDC quickly modified and then quality-checked CDC\u2019s existing\u00a0H7 rRT-PCR test and drafted protocols and guidance for its use. On April 22, 2013, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an Emergency Use Authorization and the H7 rRT-PCR test with test components and CDC guidance were made available to public health laboratories so they would be able to test for H7N9 viruses too.\nTop of PageInternational Reagent Resource\nWhile RT-PCR is fast and accurate, it requires a steady stream of laboratory supplies called reagents (primers, probes and enzymes) to perform testing, which can become scarce or costly during outbreaks when testing demands increase.\nTo address this potential shortcoming, in 2008 CDC established the Influenza Reagent Resource (IRR) as a warehouse for CDC-developed influenza supplies that laboratories need to carry out basic research; develop diagnostics, vaccines and drugs; and conduct surveillance for emerging influenza threats. During the pandemic, the IRR proved to be a critical resource in terms of providing domestic and international laboratories with the supplies needed to test for the new 2009 H1N1 virus.\nTen years later, the IRR is firmly established as a central component of influenza research, surveillance and diagnostic testing in the United States. Further, it also has been expanded to include production and distribution of additional CDC-developed reagents for a wider range of pathogens that are within the scope of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD).Some of the newer additions include reagents for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV), meningitis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The program\u2019s broader scope is reflected in a new name, the International Reagent Resource.\nWith regard to pandemic preparedness, public health laboratories across the globe continue to use the reagents they receive from the IRR for surveillance of novel influenza viruses (such as H7N9 and H5N1) in tandem with the World Health Organization (WHO) Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS).external icon For influenza and other pathogens, CDC\u2019s subject matter experts provide technical guidance and oversight to ensure that IRR acquires, authenticates, manufactures and distributes quality-controlled reagents that support global surveillance efforts.\nTop of PageAdvances in Tests Used in Clinical Settings\n\nCompared to ten years ago, clinicians now have more tests available for detection of influenza viruses in respiratory specimens, including a wider selection of highly accurate molecular assays (some rapid, some not), and improved rapid influenza antigen detection tests (RIDTs).\nRapid and accurate diagnosis of influenza virus infection facilitates timely patient management for seasonal influenza as well as pandemic influenza. Influenza testing has been used to inform decisions on the use of antiviral drugs for treatment, to avoid misuse of antibiotics for treatment, and to reduce the need for other diagnostic tests. Influenza testing also can be helpful in informing recommendations for sick people living with others who are at high risk of developing serious influenza complications. See\u00a0Guide for considering influenza testing when influenza viruses are circulating in the community for more information.)\nThe need for better rapid influenza tests and clear rapid test guidance for clinicians became apparent during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, when false-negative rapid antigen detection test results contributed to delays and missed opportunities in treating pandemic flu virus-infected patients with antiviral drugs; and delays in implementing infection control measures for such patients. [5]\nShortly after the pandemic, CDC and partners began working to address issues with rapid antigen detection tests available at the time, reaching an important milestone in 2017 when rapid influenza antigen detection tests (RIDTs) were reclassified by FDA (described in more detail, below) and held to higher standards.\nIn June 2014, a new kind of rapid influenza test was approved by FDA (the Alere (TM) i Influenza A&B test by Alere Scarborough, Inc D/B/A Binax, Inc, now owned by Abbott and called the ID NOWTIM Influenza A&B) external iconwhich detects flu A and B viruses by detecting the PB2 flu virus gene in respiratory specimens. This approval marked the beginning of a new category of tests, referred to as rapid influenza molecular assays.\nRapid influenza molecular assays are a relatively new type of influenza diagnostic test. These tests are similar to RT-PCR (which is also a molecular process and currently the gold standard for influenza virus detection), in that both tests use nucleic acid amplification, which detects influenza viruses in a respiratory specimen by amplifying (multiplying) certain nucleic acids (building blocks of genes) in the influenza virus genome.\nSince 2014, other rapid influenza molecular assays have been approved by FDA and are available for use in clinical settings. Of those, some are approved for point-of-care or bedside use, and do not require a clinical laboratory, including Cobas\u00ae Influenza A/B and Cobas\u00ae Influenza A/B RSV Assay by Roche Molecular Diagnostics; Xpert Xpress Flu and Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV by Cepheid; Accula Flu A/Flu B assay by Mesa Biotech Inc,; and ID Now TM by Abbot.\nRapid influenza molecular assays have a strong ability to identify correctly patients with evidence of influenza virus infection (referred to as high sensitivity, greater than 90%) and a strong ability to identify correctly patients without evidence of influenza virus infection, referred to as high specificity (90-100%). These assays produce results in 15 to 30 minutes, making them a convenient option for clinical management of patients. Other rapid influenza molecular assays (such as the Cobas\u00ae Influenza A/B & RSV Assay by Roche Molecular Diagnostics) are approved that detect influenza A and B viruses and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in respiratory specimens. These tests are particularly useful in the clinical management of young children with acute respiratory illness, but can be used for persons of all ages.\nAdditionally, a number of other influenza molecular assays are FDA-approved, for use in a moderately complex or complex hospital clinical laboratory. These assays may take more than one hour to produce results. Many of these molecular assays detect influenza A and B viruses as well as other respiratory viruses such as adenovius, coronavirus, human metapneumovirus, human rhinovirus/enterovirus, parainfluenza virus, and RSV. Some also detect some respiratory bacterial infections.\nBoth rapid molecular and other molecular assays are more accurate than previously available influenza tests for use in clinical settings. These advances in molecular technology provide more-accurate influenza testing results and are likely to improve clinical management of patients with suspected influenza in ambulatory care clinics and emergency departments, and in hospitalized patients as well.\nWith regard to rapid influenza antigen detection tests (RIDTs), to address the issues identified during the pandemic, in 2011 the CDC, the Joint Commission, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), the Medical College of Wisconsin (MCW) and other public and private partners addressed key RIDT-related issues by:\n\nCreating the first method for systematically evaluating commercially available RIDTs, described in a 2012 Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) article\nEnhancing awareness among clinicians of appropriate RIDT protocols with new courses, videos and decision-making tools, and;\nWorking with FDA to reclassify RIDTs from Class I to Class II with Special Controls, thereby holding current and new RIDTs to higher performance standards.\n\nReclassification means that RIDTs are now subject to the following requirements [6]:\n\nManufacturers must test their RIDTs annually to ensure they can detect currently circulating seasonal flu viruses. RIDTs with lower sensitivity to those flu viruses will need to indicate so on their labeling.\nRIDTs must meet minimum performance criteria, such as high sensitivity and high specificity to detect flu viruses in respiratory specimens compared to RT-PCR or viral culture. This means that currently FDA-approved RIDTs will now be more accurate in detecting flu viruses in respiratory specimens than previous RIDTs.\nIn the event of a pandemic, manufacturers must test the reactivity of their RIDTs with the newly emergent flu virus as soon as virus samples become available.\nSince 2017 when reclassification of RIDTs occurred, manufacturers have made positive, steady changes to rapid influenza antigen detection tests, but more work still needs to be done.\n\nTop of PageSurveillance\nRight-sizing initiative \n\nThe massive amount of laboratory testing that occurred during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic provided an opportunity for researchers to identify the optimal levels of influenza surveillance and laboratory testing needed in the United States, including ways to improve efficiency.\nTo answer those questions, in 2010, CDC and the Association of Public Health laboratories (APHL) began developing a \u201cright-size\u201d approach to influenza virologic surveillance which was based on extensive input from public health laboratories and stakeholders. Since then, this right-size approach has helped public health laboratories to:\n\nstandardize virologic surveillance practices, determine the optimal number of specimens to test to produce statistical confidence in resulting data, and define public health surveillance priorities;\nadopt requirements, resources and statistical calculators that aid in planning and justifying budget and resource requests;\nincrease the understanding and support from political leaders and the public;\nspeak a common language between laboratories and epidemiologists; and\nassist decision makers in analyzing the impacts of budget decisions on national surveillance objectives, especially with regard to pandemic preparedness capacity.\n\nTop of PageAutomated transmission of laboratory reports\nIn addition to identifying the optimum \u201csampling\u201d strategy, major improvements in sharing this data have taken place. In March 2010, five laboratories were routinely sharing data electronically with CDC. Today, all public health laboratories at the state level and some local public health and clinical laboratories send data electronically to CDC\u2019s Influenza Division This increase has improved the timeliness and completeness of reporting, for both seasonal influenza surveillance activities and the identification of novel influenza A viruses.\nIncorporation of NCHS mortality data\nIn collaboration with the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), since the 2015-2016 flu season CDC\u2019s Influenza Division has used mortality data collected from death certificates and reported to NCHS as the principal tool to track influenza-associated mortality in the United States.\nThe shift to NCHS data marked a significant advance in the capacity to track flu mortality, owing in part to efforts made by NCHS to improve the timeliness of jurisdiction reporting and modernize the infrastructure of national vital statistics, all of which resulted in a system capable of supporting near real-time surveillance of most deaths in the United States.\nThe new system presents deaths by the date of occurrence rather than by the date on which deaths were registered. It also provides a consistent case definition and covers nearly all deaths occurring in the United States, which is an improvement over the previous (now retired) system which accounted for only 25 percent of all US deaths.\nInclusion of electronic data in ILINet\n\nCDC\u2019s U.S. Outpatient Influenza-Like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet) collects data each week from up to 3,500 outpatient health care providers across all 50 states, Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Each week, these health care providers report the total number of patients seen, and the number of patients seen with influenza-like illness (ILI), by five age groups. The process of reporting numbers of total patients and ILI patients was labor-intensive, sometimes leading to reporting delays and dips in participation. Since the pandemic, more ILINet providers have used electronic health records in determining ILI and patient visits, thereby reducing the reporting burden and providing more-comprehensive, efficient and timely surveillance. ILINet now captures more patient visits: during the 2018-19 season, more than one million patient visits were reported weekly, almost double the number of patient visits reported weekly during the 2009 pandemic.\nAntiviral resistance testing\nAnother step forward in surveillance is the number of public health laboratories in the U.S. that test for resistance to influenza antiviral medications, which increased from four laboratories before the 2009 H1N1 pandemic to 20 laboratories in 2019. This improvement was accomplished through training courses, site visits, technical and other support from CDC. In addition, four laboratories are now able to conduct advanced testing for antiviral drug resistance, using a more sensitive and complex procedure. Since 2018, CDC\u2019s influenza laboratories have been testing seasonal and animal viruses for susceptibility to the newest anti-influenza drug \u2013 baloxavir marboxil (Xofluza) and a CDC-developed assay is now being implemented at the public health laboratory designated for antiviral testing (NIRC, Albany NY). Lastly, in collaboration with a World Health Organization (WHO) expert group, reference laboratory materials for detection and reporting of influenza drug resistance have been developed and shared with laboratories around the world.\nTop of PageThe Burden of Influenza\nDuring the pandemic, influenza hospitalization rates increased, particularly among groups of people at high risk of developing serious flu complications.\nThe Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET) conducts population-based surveillance for laboratory-confirmed influenza-related hospitalizations in children and adults. It has provided critical data for:\n\ninforming policy and decision making, especially with regard to vaccine and antiviral prioritization;\nevaluating the effectiveness and safety of pandemic vaccine; and,\nidentifying groups at high risk for severe flu complications.\n\nOver the course of the pandemic, CDC refined and revised its hospitalization surveillance methods, eventually developing a way to use FluSurv-NET data to estimate the range of 2009 pandemic flu illnesses, hospitalizations and deaths (also referred to as \u2018estimates of flu burden\u2019) in the United States.\nSince the 2009 pandemic, this method of estimation has been applied at the end of each flu season as a means of illustrating the national impact of seasonal flu. In 2019, CDC also began providing on a weekly basis preliminary estimates of the burden of influenza during flu season.\nBurden of influenza averted through vaccination\n\nCDC also developed estimates of the number of flu illnesses, hospitalizations and deaths prevented by flu vaccination each flu season. These estimates are made with mathematical models that combine illness rates, vaccine coverage, and vaccine effectiveness, to estimate the amount of flu that would have occurred without flu vaccination. The amount of flu that was prevented by vaccination was the difference between what would have occurred and what was estimated to have actually occurred. CDC has continued to estimate the benefits of influenza vaccination each season. Now, CDC and its partners are better able to communicate the benefits of flu vaccination and provide clear evidence on the public health impact that vaccination can have in reducing flu illness.\nTop of PageVaccine effectiveness monitoring\nWhile FluSurv-NET provided vaccine effectiveness (VE) data during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, the US Flu VE Network has yielded in-depth data about how well flu vaccines are working each flu season since its inception in 2005.\nSeasonal VE data are instrumental in making vaccine policy decisions and improving virus selection to update the composition of seasonal vaccines. VE data are also pivotal to understanding the epidemiology and severity of pandemic and seasonal influenza and to mounting an appropriate responses.\nFollowing the pandemic, multiple improvements were made to the US Flu VE Network including expanding the number of sites, increasing enrollment, improving the timeliness of data collection and reporting, and building an infrastructure for conducting special studies to improve the benefits of vaccines. In addition, in 2016-17 CDC established the Hospitalized Adult Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Network (HAIVEN), which focuses on VE among severely ill adults, as opposed to VE among persons seen as outpatients.\nTop of PageWith regard to available data, at the time of the pandemic, VE studies had shown that influenza vaccination reduced the risk of mild or moderately severe influenza by approximately half among children and adults, but there were gaps in knowledge about how well the vaccine worked in preventing lab-confirmed influenza among pregnant women and in preventing life-threatening influenza among children and adults.\nVE data directly influence policymakers\u2019 decisions regarding influenza vaccination policy both in the United States and in other countries, so over the last 10 years CDC has created partnerships and funded research to address major VE knowledge gaps, all with an eye toward advancing vaccination efforts in the U.S. and internationally.\nPregnant Women\n\nThe first CDC-funded study to address these gaps, which was also the first to use laboratory-confirmed influenza outcomes to assess VE among pregnant women, was published in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases in January 2014. This study, which looked at Kaiser Permanente health plan members in two regions, showed that influenza vaccination reduced their risk of flu illness by half during 2010 to 2012, indicating that flu vaccine works about as well in pregnant women as in other young, healthy adults. The study showed influenza vaccine effectiveness estimates among pregnant women were similar to those found in other studies among young adults, which ranged from 44% to 51% from 2010 to 2012.\nSee\u00a0Study Finds Flu Vaccine Reduces Risk of Flu Illness in Pregnant Women by Half for more information.\nThe second CDC-funded study was published in Clinical Infectious Diseases in October 2018: it was the first study to show that vaccination protects pregnant women against flu-associated hospitalization.\nTo conduct this study, CDC partnered with a number of other public health agencies and health care systems in Australia, Canada, Israel, and the United States through the Pregnancy Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Network (PREVENT), which consists of health care systems with integrated laboratory, medical, and vaccination records. Sites retrospectively examined medical records of more than two million women who were pregnant from 2010 through 2016 to identify those who were hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed flu.\nKey findings of this study include the following:\n\nOver the course of six flu seasons, getting a flu shot reduced a pregnant woman\u2019s risk of being hospitalized from flu by an average of 40 percent.\nMore than 80 percent of pregnancies overlapped with flu season, underscoring the likelihood that pregnant women will be exposed to flu at some point during their pregnancy.\nFlu vaccine was equally protective for pregnant women with underlying medical problems such as asthma and diabetes, which also increase the risk of serious medical complications including a worsening of those chronic conditions.\nFlu vaccine was equally protective for women during all three trimesters.\n\nSee Flu Vaccine Reduces Risk of Flu Hospitalization Among Pregnant Women for more information.\nChildren and Adults:\nIn March 2014 another critical gap was filled, when the first study to estimate VE in children against flu admissions to pediatric intensive care units (PICUs) was published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases. CDC researchers found that getting a flu vaccine reduces a child\u2019s risk of flu-related intensive care hospitalization by 74%, illustrating the important protection flu vaccine can provide to children against more-serious flu outcomes.\nResearchers analyzed the medical records of 216 children age 6 months through 17 years admitted to 21 PICUs in the United States during the 2010-2011 and 2011-2012 flu seasons.\nThough flu vaccination was associated with a significant reduction in risk of PICU admission, flu vaccine coverage was relatively low among the children in this study: only 18 percent of flu cases admitted to the ICU had been fully vaccinated.\nMore than half (55 percent) of PICU cases had at least one underlying chronic medical condition that placed them at higher risk of serious flu-related complications.\nSee\u00a0New Study Shows Flu Vaccine Reduced Children\u2019s Risk of Intensive Care Unit Flu Admission by Three-Fourths for more information.\nIn August 2018, a CDC-supported study published in Vaccine was the first to provide statistically significant VE estimates for adults against hospitalization and admission to ICU.\nThe study was conducted over four flu seasons from 2012 to 2015 and found that flu vaccination prevented severe disease:\n\nFlu vaccination among adults reduced the risk of being admitted to the hospital with flu and placed in a general ward bed by 37 percent.\n\n\nFlu vaccination was even more effective in preventing the most severe forms of flu and reduced the risk of being admitted to an ICU with flu by 82 percent.\n\nBecause flu vaccine varies in how well it works and people who are vaccinated may still get sick, the study also looked at whether flu vaccination reduced the severity of illness among hospitalized people who were vaccinated compared to those who were unvaccinated and found that:\n\nAmong adults who were admitted to the hospital with flu, vaccinated adults were 59 percent less likely to have very severe illness resulting in ICU admission than those who had not been vaccinated.\nAmong adults in the ICU with flu, vaccinated patients on average spent 4 fewer days in the hospital than those who were not vaccinated previously.\n\nThe study was a collaborative project with CDC, conducted through the Southern Hemisphere Influenza and Vaccine Effectiveness Research and Surveillance project, which prospectively enrolled hospitalized adults 18 years and older from 2012 to 2015 in Auckland, New Zealand. Eligible hospitalized patients were those who had an overnight admission with acute respiratory illness. Once enrolled in the study, patients self-reported their flu vaccination status and were tested for flu infection by RT-PCR.\nSee Study Shows Flu Vaccine Reduces Risk of Severe Illness\u00a0for more information.\nTop of PageIn February 2018, the complex process of making CVVs for avian H5 and H7 influenza viruses was streamlined by the Federal Select Agent Program with its decision to remove the requirement for live bird lethality testing.\nH5 and H7 avian influenza viruses are classified as Select Agents until it is shown that the viruses are low-pathogenic (unable to cause disease and mortality in chickens in a laboratory setting).\nPreviously, live bird lethality testing was used to determine whether an avian influenza CVV was highly pathogenic or low pathogenic, and thus if it should managed as a Select Agent.\nNow, H5 and H7-derived CVVs no longer need to be tested in live birds to show low pathogenicity. Instead, other data may be submitted in lieu of bird lethality testing.\nThe Federal Select Agent Program is managed jointly by the Division of Select Agents and Toxins at the CDC, and the Agriculture Select Agent Services at the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.\nPrevention\nInfluenza Vaccines\nCDC and its partners have made significant progress in influenza surveillance; diagnostics; characterizing viruses for vaccine strain selection; and developing systems to evaluate the effectiveness of influenza vaccines over the last ten years.\nFor example, with regard to vaccine development, by using newer production technologies CDC can now identify and provide candidate vaccine viruses for novel influenza threats to manufacturers within a matter of weeks.\nThis and other improvements have helped to better protect the public from seasonal and pandemic influenza threats through vaccination. However, to more fully protect Americans from seasonal and pandemic flu, more effective vaccines are needed and more people still need to receive annual flu vaccines.\nIn line with that public health mission, more doses of seasonal vaccines and different vaccine products are available than ever before. In addition to trivalent inactivated vaccine and live attenuated influenza vaccine, the following vaccines have been approved by the FDA and are now available:\n\na\u00a0high dose vaccine that is designed specifically for\u00a0people 65 and older to help create a stronger antibody response;\na\u00a0trivalent flu vaccine made with adjuvant (an ingredient added to vaccine that helps create a stronger immune response), which was approved for people 65 years of age and older;\nthe first U.S.-approved cell-based flu vaccine, which can potentially be made more quickly than traditional egg-based vaccines and does not require a large supply of eggs to produce;\nquadrivalent (four component) flu vaccines that protect against both lineages of influenza B viruses thus offering expanded protection against circulating influenza viruses; and,\nrecombinant influenza vaccines, which do not require an egg-grown vaccine virus or eggs to produce, and which may be manufactured more quickly than egg-based vaccines.\n\nCDC is currently exploring new ways to further improve influenza vaccine through the influenza vaccine improvement initiative (iVii). The initiative includes two primary goals.\nGoal 1: Build the evidence base for developing more-effective influenza vaccines, and increase the impact of vaccines that are currently available.\nThis goal points to the need for deeper data, so during the 2018-19 season, CDC increased the number and scope of VE Network participants by over 1,500 children and adults, bringing the total number of participants enrolled to more than 10,500.\nCDC also is increasing the diversity of people who can be enrolled in studies and has expanded VE monitoring through innovative use of health care and other data sources outside of the US Flu VE Network. The laboratory process of evaluating vaccine response through the use of enhanced serologic and cellular testing has also been improved.\nGoal 2: Increase the capacity of CDC laboratories to select, develop, evaluate and perform virus characterization to provide candidate vaccine viruses.\nTo accomplish this, CDC is employing state-of-the-art technologies to increase the volume of laboratory testing being done. CDC also is working on developing new assays for manufacturers and regulatory laboratories, and planning evaluation projects that support vaccine improvement.\nCDC also is focusing on expanding and improving global virus detection, and improving vaccine effectiveness monitoring. This is being done through the expansion of Next Generation Sequencing and fully transitioning to the Sequence-First initiative described earlier. In the process, CDC has also worked with partners to automate the pipeline used to produce, store and share the enormous volume of NGS data.\nCDC also is piloting an advanced laboratory strategy to identify viruses, using antigenic data that are likely to predominate in the human population in future influenza seasons.\nCDC meets regularly with vaccine manufacturers and other WHO Collaborating Centers and Essential Regulatory Laboratories including FDA\u2019s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research to share information on a number of vaccine-related topics.\nTopics include the availability of candidate vaccine viruses for use in the development and production of seasonal influenza vaccines, the availability of protocols and reagents needed for the development, standardization, and regulation of influenza vaccines, and to discuss potential issues related to the timely production of seasonal influenza vaccines. The group meets from the time the vaccine composition is announced until vaccines are released for distribution to health care providers, for both the northern and southern hemisphere influenza seasons.\nSeparately, frequent Flu Risk Management Meetings serve as a venue to discuss issues relating to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) response to seasonal and pandemic influenza. Subjects for discussion include but are not limited to seasonal surveillance updates, effectiveness of influenza vaccines, vaccine and antiviral stockpiles, emerging influenza virus surveillance, clinical trial response to influenza outbreaks of novel influenza viruses, and pandemic preparedness.\nTop of PageWhen a pandemic influenza A virus emerges \u2013 like H1N1 in 2009 \u2013 well-matched vaccines may not be available for 6 months or longer, and antiviral medications may be reserved for treatment and be in short supply because of high demand.\nThe goals of community mitigation measures are to delay the spread of the disease and reduce the impact of an influenza pandemic in U.S. communities.\nCommunity mitigation measures are often referred to as Non Pharmaceutical Interventions (or NPIs), and include actions other than use of vaccines and medications that people and communities can take to help slow the spread of a pandemic influenza virus.\nCommunity Mitigation Measures\nCommunity Mitigation Guidelines to Prevent Pandemic Influenza \u2013 United States, 2017 \nBased on lessons learned from the 2009 H1N1 pandemic response and an expanded contemporary NPI evidence base, CDC published updated pre-pandemic planning guidelines \u2013 Community Mitigation Guidelines to Prevent Pandemic Influenza \u2013 United States, 2017 \u2013 in MMWR Recommendations and Reports on April 21, 2017. The guidelines offer free CE credits for healthcare and public health practitioners, and are available at https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/66/rr/pdfs/rr6601.pdfpdf icon.\nThe 2017 guidelines summarize key lessons learned from the 2009 H1N1 pandemic response; encourage state and local public health officials to plan and prepare for implementing NPIs early in an influenza pandemic in community settings; describe new or updated pandemic planning and assessment tools; and provide the latest scientific findings to support updated recommendations on the use of NPIs to help slow the spread and decrease the impact of an influenza pandemic. The 2009 H1N1 pandemic response highlighted that pre-pandemic planning and preparedness \u2013 from local to federal levels \u2013 must be broad, flexible, and multi-sectoral, and emphasized the critical value of public engagement and community preparedness \u2013 including families, schools, and businesses \u2013 for successful NPI implementation during a pandemic. Research conducted during and in the wake of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic documented that public acceptance of NPIs in the United States is generally high, even for disruptive measures like school closures. These findings underscore the importance of pandemic preparedness at all levels of society to ensure timely implementation of community mitigation measures from the onset of a future pandemic, when these measures may be the only tool available in many jurisdictions.\nTo help implement the 2017 guidelines and to assist states and localities with pre-pandemic planning and decision-making in their communities, CDC also published online six plain-language, pre-pandemic NPI planning guides for various audiences and community settings: households, educational settings, workplace settings, community- and faith-based organizations serving vulnerable populations, event planners of large/mass gatherings, and health communicators in community preparedness. The six guides are available.\nCDC continues to conduct and support research to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of NPI implementation in various community settings. Select NPI research references, as well as additional NPI communication, education, and training materials, are available at CDC\u2019s dedicated NPI website.\nTop of PageTreatment\n\nThe number of available, approved and recommended treatment options has increased in the last ten years.\nDuring the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, the influenza antiviral medication oseltamivir (oral oseltamivir, available under the trade name Tamiflu\u00ae) was used extensively for treatment, while zanamivir (inhaled, trade name Relenza\u00ae) was used less.\nOral oseltamivir\u2019s widespread use was due to it being approved, recommended and utilized for treatment of patients hospitalized with severe influenza. It also was recommended for use in hospitalized patients with non-severe influenza, although no antiviral medications were approved by FDA for use in that group.\nOutpatients could be prescribed either oral oseltamivir or inhaled zanamivir, which were both approved for early treatment of uncomplicated influenza by FDA.\nOf the two medications, CDC was more concerned with the possibility of resistance emerging against oseltamivir, which did happen, but not often. The oseltamivir-resistant viruses that did emerge were not transmitted easily from person to person, and zanamivir was used effectively to treat them.\nBeginning in April 2009 and continuing for a few years after the pandemic, the FDA\u2019s Emergency Investigational New Drug (EIND) program provided an application process which authorized investigational use of IV zanamivir for patients with severe and life-threatening influenza.\nLater, on October 23rd, 2009, FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for IV Peramivir. At the time, IV Peramivir was an investigational intravenous antiviral drug used rarely to treat people who had been hospitalized with severe influenza. The drug was held in the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) and distributed by CDC under the EUA. Licensed clinicians were able to request this product through the CDC website electronic request system, and product was delivered directly to hospital facilities until June 2010 when the EUA was terminated.\nTop of PageFollowing the pandemic, in December 2014, IV Peramivir was approved by FDA for early treatment of uncomplicated influenza in outpatients, which also opened up some off-label use in treating influenza in hospitalized patients. Previously, with the exception of the IV Peramivir EUA during the pandemic, oseltamivir and zanamivir were the only recommended antiviral medications for treatment of influenza. (The other approved antiviral drugs \u2013 amantadine and rimantadine \u2013 were not and are still not recommended due to high levels of resistance detected in circulating influenza viruses).\nRoughly three years later, in September 2017, FDA approved the first generic version of oseltamivir.\nOseltamivir, zanamivir and IV peramivir are all neuraminidase-inhibitor influenza antiviral medications, so named because each works by targeting the neuraminidase surface protein of the influenza virus to stop the virus from being released from infected cells and spreading to healthy cells.\nIn December 2018, a new influenza antiviral medication called oral baloxavir marboxil (trade name Xofluza\u00ae) was approved by FDA and is recommended for treatment of influenza. Baloxavir works differently, primarily by preventing an influenza virus from multiplying when it is inside a cell. Because baloxavir works differently, it is in a new class of antiviral medications called cap-dependent endonuclease inhibitors. Like the neuraminidase-inhibitor medications, baloxavir has activity against both influenza A and B viruses. Baloxavir is approved for early treatment of uncomplicated influenza in outpatients aged 12 years and older.\nWith more antiviral medications approved, recommended and available, treatment options have improved for both hospitalized patients with severe influenza and outpatients seeking treatment early for uncomplicated influenza. There remains a gap, however, in approved antiviral treatment options for hospitalized patients with non-severe influenza, although CDC and IDSA (Infectious Diseases Society of America) continue to recommend that those patients be treated with neuraminidase-inhibitor antiviral medications.\nTop of PageDecision-making tools\nRisk assessment (IRAT)\nThe 2009 H1N1 pandemic highlighted the public health value of developing an objective, scientifically based tool for assessing the potential pandemic risk posed to humans by influenza A viruses circulating in animals. To fill that need, CDC developed an evaluation tool now called the Influenza Risk Assessment Tool (IRAT) with help from global animal and human health influenza experts. IRAT launched in 2011 and since then CDC has used it to evaluate the potential risk posed by viruses that are not currently circulating in people. The IRAT relies on input from subject matter experts representing a variety of expertise in the study of influenza viruses. It uses 10 evaluation criteria grouped into major categories including properties of the virus, attributes of the human population, and epidemiology and ecology of the virus, to generate scores that indicate the potential risk of the virus to emerge as a pandemic virus, and the potential impact if it does.\nThe IRAT is not a prediction tool. Rather, the IRAT provides structure to prioritize and maximize investments in pandemic preparedness; identify key gaps in information; document transparently the data and scientific process used to inform management decisions associated with pandemic preparedness; provide a flexible means to easily and regularly update the risk assessment of novel flu viruses as new information becomes available; communicate effectively to the general public, policymakers, public health laboratories and other stakeholders; and provide a means to weigh the 10 evaluation criteria differently depending on whether the intent is to measure the ability of a virus to \u201cemerge\u201d as a pandemic-capable virus, or \u201cimpact\u201d the human population after emerging.\nSince its inception eight years ago, the IRAT has been used by CDC to evaluate and inform pandemic preparedness decisions for 16 viruses, the results of which are listed at Summary of Influenza Risk Assessment Tool (IRAT) Results.\nTop of PageForecasting\nUnlike traditional surveillance systems that lag behind the real-time situation, flu forecasting offers the possibility to look into the future and forecast when and where flu increases will occur, how large the impact of flu will be, and when flu will peak. Forecasts can inform messaging to health care providers regarding influenza vaccination and antiviral treatment for patients, help to prepare for an influx of illnesses and hospitalizations, and be used to guide community mitigation strategies, such as school closures.\nTo support the development of the science of flu forecasting and its application for public health, CDC, through the Epidemic Prediction Initiative (EPI), organized the first FluSight challenge to forecast the timing, intensity, and short-term activity of the influenza season during the 2013-14 season. Each influenza season since then, Influenza Division researchers have worked with CDC\u2019s EPI and other external researchers to improve flu forecasting. CDC provides forecasting teams data, relevant public health forecasting targets, and forecast accuracy metrics evaluated against actual flu activity while each team submits their forecasts based on a variety of methods and data sources each week. During the 2018\u201319 season, forecasting teams provided over 30 national-level forecasts each week.\nThese challenges have provided the scientific and public health community with experience in real-time forecasting, the ability to evaluate forecast accuracy, and familiarity in communicating and applying these forecasts in real-world settings. These experiences are critical to developing a network of forecasters capable of providing results that public health officials can use, both in seasons and during an influenza pandemic.\nForecasts are currently used to inform CDC\u2019s activity summaries provided to public health officials and CDC leadership, and to inform messages to the general public regarding the timing of the influenza season and steps the public can take to protect their health.\nTop of PageInternational work\n\nCDC has strong global ties with other WHO Collaborating Centers for Influenza, National Influenza Centers and ministries of health around the world. These collaborators provided critical data throughout the influenza pandemic on how, when and where the pandemic virus might be changing and if the monovalent pandemic vaccine would continue to be effective in preventing infection.\nCDC\u2019s Influenza Division formed an influenza international capacity-building initiative in 2004, which provided a five-year period of financial support for nine countries to improve laboratory diagnostics and sentinel surveillance for influenza-like illness and severe acute respiratory infection. In 2009, this number increased to 37 countries receiving support under 39 cooperative agreements.\nThus, the 2009 H1N1 pandemic occurred at a time when many of the 37 countries benefited from the newly established influenza surveillance and laboratory capacities. The pandemic provided the ultimate test to determine whether their laboratory diagnostics and surveillance systems were indeed strong enough to manage the massive surges in flu activity that would come their way.\nShortly after the pandemic, eight of the 37 countries transitioned to the program\u2019s second five-year period, called the sustainability period. During this period, financial support was reduced as the programs focused on sustaining the gains made in laboratory diagnostics and surveillance. The countries focused on standardizing foundational aspects of influenza surveillance including regular influenza activity reporting and sending viruses to CDC and other WHO Collaborating Centers, all with an eye toward ensuring preparedness for the next pandemic.\nNow, following 10 years of the pandemic\u2019s race around the globe, which caused hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide, many countries have graduated from the sustainability period to maintenance and some are now developing in-country seasonal influenza vaccination programs based on their influenza surveillance data.\nThe 2009 H1N1 pandemic tested U.S. laboratory and surveillance systems and highlighted many successes along the way, shining a light on one of the biggest takeaways of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic: develop seasonal influenza epidemiology and laboratory capacity that\u2019s flexible enough to handle the next pandemic.\nTop of Page1. http://www.cdc.gov/flu/spotlights/pandemic-global-estimates.htm\n2.

Flu vaccination is especially important for adults 65 years and older, who account for most hospitalizations and deaths from flu and from COVID-19.\nProtect Your Health\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn This Page\n\nFlu Shots for People 65 and OlderOther Preventive ActionsSymptoms and TreatmentAdditional Resources \n\nIt has been recognized for many years that people 65 years and older are at high risk of developing serious complications from flu\u00a0compared with young, healthy adults. This risk is due in part to changes in immune defenses with increasing age. While flu seasons vary in severity, during most seasons, people 65 years and older bear the greatest burden of severe flu disease. In recent years, for example, it\u2019s estimated\u00a0that between 70 percent and 85 percent of seasonal flu-related deaths have occurred in people 65 years and older, and between 50 percent and 70 percent of seasonal flu-related hospitalizations have occurred among people in this age group.\nA Flu Vaccine is the Best Protection Against Flu\nFlu Vaccine Reduces Risk of Flu Illness and Serious OutcomesFlu vaccination has many benefits. It has been shown to reduce flu illnesses and also to reduce the risk of more serious flu outcomes that can result in hospitalization or even death in older people. Flu vaccination has been shown in several studies to reduce severity of illness in people who get vaccinated but still get sick.\nMore\nThe best way to protect against flu and its potentially serious complications is with a flu vaccine.\u00a0CDC recommends that almost everyone 6 months of age and older get a seasonal flu vaccine each year by the end of October. However, as long as flu viruses are circulating, vaccination should continue throughout flu season, even into January or later.\nFlu vaccination is especially important for people 65 years and older because they are at high risk of developing serious complications from flu. Flu vaccines are updated each season as needed to keep up with changing viruses. Also, immunity wanes over a year so annual vaccination is needed to ensure the best possible protection against flu. A flu vaccine protects against the flu viruses that research indicates will be most common during the upcoming season. (See Vaccine Virus Selection\u00a0for this season\u2019s exact vaccine composition.) Flu vaccines for 2020-2021 have been updated from last season\u2019s vaccine to better match circulating viruses. Immunity from vaccination fully sets in after about two weeks.\nBecause of age-related changes in their immune systems, people 65 years and older may not respond as well to vaccination as younger people. Although immune responses may be lower in older people, studiesexternal icon\u00a0have consistently found that flu vaccine has been effective in reducing the risk of medical visits and hospitalizations associated with flu.\nTypes of Flu Shots for People 65 and Older\nPeople 65 years and older should get a flu shot, not a nasal spray vaccine. They can get any flu vaccine approved for use in their age group with no preference for any one vaccine over another. There are regular flu shots that are approved for use in people 65 years and older and there also are two vaccines designed specifically for this group:\nHigh Dose Flu Vaccine\nThe high dose vaccine (brand name Fluzone High-Dose) contains four times the amount of antigen (the inactivated virus that promotes a protective immune response) as a regular flu shot. It is associated with a stronger immune response following vaccination (higher antibody production). Results from a clinical trial of more than 30,000 participants showed that adults 65 years and older who received the high dose vaccine had 24% fewer influenza illnesses as compared to those who received the standard dose flu vaccine. The high dose vaccine has been approved for use in the United States since 2009. Learn more about high dose flu vaccine here.\nAdjuvanted Flu Vaccine\nThe adjuvanted flu vaccine (brand name Fluad) is made with MF59 adjuvant, an additive that can create a stronger immune response to vaccination. In a recent review of multiple vaccine trials, older adults who received a MF59-adjuvated vaccine had a significantly higher immune response than those who received a standard flu vaccine, The adjuvanted\u00a0vaccine was available for the first time in the United States during the 2016-2017 flu season. Learn more about adjuvanted flu vaccine here.\nHigh Dose and Adjuvanted Flu Vaccine Side Effects\nThe high dose and adjuvanted flu vaccines may result in more of the temporary, mild side effects that can occur with standard-dose seasonal shots. Side effects can include pain, redness or swelling at the injection site, headache, muscle ache and malaise, and typically resolve with 1 to 3 days.\nMore information about different types of flu vaccines can be found here.\nGet pneumococcal vaccines\n\nPeople who are 65 years and older also should be up to date with pneumococcal vaccination\u00a0to protect against pneumococcal disease, such as pneumonia, meningitis, and bloodstream infections. Talk to your health care provider to find out which pneumococcal vaccines are recommended for you.\nPneumococcal pneumonia is an example of a serious flu-related complication\u00a0that can cause death. You can get the pneumococcal vaccine your provider recommends when you get a flu vaccine.\n\n\nOther Preventive Actions\nIn addition to getting a flu shot, people 65 years and older should take the same everyday preventive actions\u00a0CDC recommends for everyone,\u00a0including avoiding people who are sick, covering coughs, and washing hands often.\n\n\n\nalert icon \n\n\nIn the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, local governments or public health departments may recommend additional precautions be taken in your community. Follow those instructions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSymptoms and Treatment\nBecause you are at high risk of developing serious flu complications, if you get sick with flu symptoms, call your health care provider right away. There are antiviral drugs\u00a0that can treat flu illness and prevent serious flu complications. CDC recommends prompt treatment for people who have influenza infection or suspected influenza infection and who are at high risk for serious flu complications, including people 65 years and older.\nSymptoms:\nFlu symptoms include fever, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, body aches, headache, chills and fatigue. Some people may also have vomiting and diarrhea. People may be infected with flu and have respiratory symptoms without a fever.\nTreatment:\n\nTreatment should begin as soon as possible because antiviral drugs work best when started early (within 48 hours after symptoms start).\nFor you to get an antiviral drug, a health care provider needs to write a prescription. These medicines fight against flu by keeping flu viruses from making more viruses in your body.\nAntiviral drugs can make your flu illness milder and make you feel better faster. They may also prevent serious health problems that can result from flu illness.\nThere are four FDA-approved influenza antiviral drugs\u00a0recommended by CDC this season that can be used to treat the flu.\n\nWhat are the emergency warning signs of flu?People experiencing these warning signs should obtain medical care right away.\n\nIn children\n\nFast breathing or trouble breathing\nBluish lips or face\nRibs pulling in with each breath\nChest pain\nSevere muscle pain (child refuses to walk)\nDehydration (no urine for 8 hours, dry mouth, no tears when crying)\nNot alert or interacting when awake\nSeizures\nFever above 104\u00b0F\nIn children less than 12 weeks, any fever\nFever or cough that improve but then return or worsen\nWorsening of chronic medical conditions\n\n\n\nIn adults\n\nDifficulty breathing or shortness of breath\nPersistent pain or pressure in the chest or abdomen\nPersistent dizziness, confusion, inability to arouse\nSeizures\nNot urinating\nSevere muscle pain\nSevere weakness or unsteadiness\nFever or cough that improve but then return or worsen\nWorsening of chronic medical conditions\n\n\n\n\nThese lists are not all inclusive.
