The cases were unlinked, though both infections were in health care providers who lived and worked in Saudi Arabia, where they are believed to have been infected. As part of the public health investigation into the imported cases, CDC collected specimens from each of the household members and the health care workers with whom the two U.S. cases had close contact. CDC then tested the specimens by rRT-PCR and by serology testing. All household members and the health care workers who cared for the cases tested negative for both active and previous infection with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). “The negative results among the contacts that CDC considered at highest risk for MERS-CoV infection are reassuring.” said David Swerdlow, M.D., who is leading CDC’s MERS-CoV response. “Today, the risk of MERS-CoV infection in the United States remains low, but it is important that we remain vigilant and quickly identify and respond to any additional importations.”    In addition to testing the household and heath care contacts, CDC, state and local public health partners, and foreign ministries of health have contacted almost all of the people who traveled on the airplanes or bus with the patients. At this time, none of the travel contacts who were tested have had evidence of being infected with MERS-CoV. Investigations, including voluntary serology testing of travel contacts, are ongoing, and the situation could change.  CDC routinely advises that people help protect themselves from respiratory illnesses by taking everyday preventive actions like washing their hands often, avoiding touching their face with unwashed hands, avoiding close contact with people who appear sick, and cleaning frequently touched surfaces.", "reports": []},

This patient is a healthcare worker who resides and works in Saudi Arabia. This case is unlinked to the first U.S. imported case of MERS reported May 2 in Indiana. Despite this second imported case, the risk to the U.S. general public from MERS still remains very low. Both imported MERS cases are healthcare workers who recently worked in and traveled from Saudi Arabia. “This second confirmed case of MERS in a person who worked in health care from an area of risk is not surprising,” said CDC Director Tom Frieden, M.D., M.P.H.”To continue to strengthen our own health security, we need to increase our global ability to support other countries to help them find and stop threats such as MERS promptly, and to prevent them whenever possible.” On May 1, the patient traveled by plane from Jeddah, Saudi Arabia to London, England, to Boston, Massachusetts, to Atlanta, Georgia, and to Orlando, Florida. The patient reported feeling unwell during the flight from Jeddah to London and continued to feel unwell on subsequent flights with reported symptoms that include fever, chills and a slight cough. On May 9, the patient went to the emergency department of a hospital in Florida and was admitted the same day. The patient is isolated, being well cared for, and is currently doing well. Because of the patient’s symptoms and travel history, the Florida Department of Health officials tested the patient for MERS Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), the virus that causes MERS. Those tests were positive, and CDC confirmed MERS-CoV infection in the patient late last night. “Given the dramatic increase in MERS cases in the Arabian Peninsula, we expected and are prepared for additional imported cases,” said Dr. Anne Schuchat, assistant surgeon general and director of CDC’s National Center for Immunizations and Respiratory Diseases. “The reason for this increase in cases is not yet known, but public health investigations are ongoing, and we are pleased to have a team in Saudi Arabia supporting some of those efforts.” CDC and Florida health officials are not yet sure how the patient became infected with the virus. Exposure may have occurred in Saudi Arabia, where outbreaks of MERS-CoV infection are occurring. Officials also do not know at this time exactly how many people had close contact with the patient. Federal, state, and local health officials are taking action to minimize the risk of spread of the virus. The hospital is using standard, contact, and airborne isolation precautions, to avoid exposure to MERS-CoV within the hospital. As part of the prevention and control measures, officials have begun reaching out to healthcare professionals, family members, and others who had close contact with the patient to provide guidance about monitoring their health and recommending they see a healthcare provider for an evaluation. Public health officials are working with airlines to identify and notify U.S. travelers who may have been in close contact with the patient on any of the flights. “The rapid identification and response to this case are a reflection of all of the work that CDC and partners have done over the past two years to prepare for MERS entering the United States,” said Schuchat. All reported cases of MERS have been linked to countries in the Arabian Peninsula. In some instances, the virus has spread from person to person through close contact, such as caring for or living with an infected person. However, there is currently no evidence of sustained spread of MERS-CoV in community settings. “The risk to the U.S. general public from MERS still remains very low,” said Schuchat. While experts do not yet know exactly how this virus is spread, CDC advises Americans to help protect themselves from respiratory illnesses by washing hands often, avoiding close contact with people who are sick, avoiding touching their eyes, nose and/or mouth with unwashed hands, and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces. At this time, CDC does not recommend anyone change their travel plans. CDC advises people traveling to the Arabian Peninsula who work in a healthcare setting to follow CDC’s recommendations for infection control. Other travelers to the Arabian Peninsula should take general steps to protect their health. Anyone who develops fever and symptoms of respiratory illness, such as cough or shortness of breath, within 14 days after traveling from countries in or near the Arabian Peninsula should call ahead to a doctor and mention their recent travel. Background Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a virus that is new to humans and was first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012. So far, including this U.S. importation, there have been 538 confirmed cases of MERS in 14 countries. Most of these people developed severe acute respiratory illness, with fever, cough, and shortness of breath; 145 people died. Officials do not know where the virus came from or exactly how it spreads. There is no available vaccine or specific treatment recommended for the virus.", "reports": []},

This virus is relatively new to humans and was first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012. “We’ve anticipated MERS reaching the US, and we’ve prepared for and are taking swift action,” said CDC Director Tom Frieden, M.D., M.P.H. “We’re doing everything possible with hospital, local, and state health officials to find people who may have had contact with this person sothey can be evaluated as appropriate. This case reminds us that we are all connected by the air we breathe, the food we eat, and the water we drink. We can break the chain of transmission in this case through focused efforts here and abroad.” On April 24, the patient traveled by plane from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia to London, England then from London to Chicago, Illinois. The patient then took a bus from Chicago to Indiana. On the 27th, the patient began to experience respiratory symptoms, including shortness of breath, coughing, and fever. The patient went to an emergency department in an Indiana hospital on April 28th and was admitted on that same day. The patient is being well cared for and is isolated; the patient is currently in stable condition. Because of the patient’s symptoms and travel history, Indiana public health officials tested for MERS-CoV. The Indiana state public health laboratory and CDC confirmed MERS-CoV infection in the patient this afternoon. “It is understandable that some may be concerned about this situation, but this first U.S. case of MERS-CoV infection represents a very low risk to the general public,” said Dr. Anne Schuchat, assistant surgeon general and director of CDC’s National Center for Immunizations and Respiratory Diseases. In some countries, the virus has spread from person to person through close contact, such as caring for or living with an infected person. However, there is currently no evidence of sustained spread of MERS-CoV in community settings. CDC and Indiana health officials are not yet sure how the patient became infected with the virus. Exposure may have occurred in Saudi Arabia, where outbreaks of MERS-CoV infection are occurring. Officials also do not know exactly how many people have had close contact with the patient. So far, including this U.S. importation, there have been 401 confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection in 12 countries. To date, all reported cases have originated in six countries in the Arabian Peninsula. Most of these people developed severe acute respiratory illness, with fever, cough, and shortness of breath; 93 people died. Officials do not know where the virus came from or exactly how it spreads. There is no available vaccine or specific treatment recommended for the virus. “In this interconnected world we live in, we expected MERS-CoV to make its way to the United States,” said Dr. Tom Frieden, Director, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “We have been preparing since 2012 for this possibility.” Federal, state, and local health officials are taking action to minimize the risk of spread of the virus. The Indiana hospital is using full precautions to avoid exposure within the hospital and among healthcare professionals and other people interacting with the patient, as recommended by CDC. In July 2013, CDC posted checklists and resource lists for healthcare facilities and providers to assist with preparing to implement infection control precautions for MERS-CoV. As part of the prevention and control measures, officials are reaching out to close contacts to provide guidance about monitoring their health. While experts do not yet know exactly how this virus is spread, CDC advises Americans to help protect themselves from respiratory illnesses by washing hands often, avoiding close contact with people who are sick, avoid touching their eyes, nose and/or mouth with unwashed hands, and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces. The largest reported outbreak to date occurred April through May 2013 in eastern Saudi Arabia and involved 23 confirmed cases in four healthcare facilities. At this time, CDC does not recommend anyone change their travel plans. The World Health Organization also has not issued Travel Health Warnings for any country related to MERS-CoV. Anyone who develops fever and cough or shortness of breath within 14 day after traveling from countries in or near the Arabian Peninsula should see their doctor and let them know where they travelled.", "reports": []},

A chain of events was started in late summer 2011 during the dry season in Zambia. Hippos, hunting for food by rooting in the soil, became infected with anthrax. People living near the sites of hippo deaths started to see the carcasses as a convenient and free source of food. The resulting outbreak of anthrax among people who had either eaten the meat of— or butchered— infected hippopotamuses became a serious and deadly twist on the title of a popular children’s game.When the Zambia Ministry of Health contacted CDC in mid-September, the anthrax outbreak had already sickened 500 people and caused 5 deaths. Mark Lehman, an Epidemic Intelligence Service officer, was sent to Chama in eastern Zambia to investigate the problem and make recommendations. Dr. Lehman first needed to determine how people were contracting the anthrax, most of which was the less lethal cutaneous (skin) form of the infection. Dr. Lehman and the team trained local community health workers to conduct surveys, which showed that the primary way people were getting infected was by carrying the hippo meat home from the butcher site. The survey also confirmed the reason they were eating hippo meat— food insecurity, or in other words, having nothing else to eat.Epidemic Intelligence Service Officer Dr. Mark Lehman with children in eastern Zambia.Armed with survey results, Dr. Lehman next assisted in resolving the outbreak, touring areas that had been affected as well as those still believed to be unaffected. He scoured game parks and lagoons in 100-plus degree temperatures and was gratified to discover many untouched hippo carcasses— an indication that people were probably understanding the risks of handling or eating the infected meat.Mark Lehman’s recommendations to the Ministry of Health included an offer of laboratory support and outbreak management strategies. He also encouraged Zambian officials to address the connection between the outbreak and environmental and food insecurity issues. Above all else, Dr. Lehman encouraged health officials to follow the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines about anthrax outbreaks. Although they had copies of the WHO guidelines, they still looked to Mark Lehman for advice; as he later reflected, “I really just continued to tell them to follow WHO guidelines, but sometimes just being there in person makes a difference.”", "reports": [{"diseases": [], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "2011-xx-xx xx:xx:xx", "locations": [{"geonames_id": 895949}]}]},

Somewhere on their journey through national parks in Wyoming, Montana, and the Dakotas, Dan picked up a rare and extremely deadly type of anthrax infection. Dan’s story starts with the extreme misfortune of getting inhalation anthrax. But some exceptional medical care and expertise, spot-on timing, and good judgments resulted in his exceptional fortune to survive the lethal disease.When Dan arrived at a friend’s home in Minnesota on August 2, 2011, he was feeling a little “punky,” but figured he was just road-weary from their long adventure. But 2 days later, on August 4, he was much worse, and instead of going home as they had planned, he was admitted to the hospital. Dan thinks that was the first in a series of good decisions that helped save his life.He was treated for what was thought to be community-acquired pneumonia. But he did not improve. An alert doctor at the local hospital, a “country boy” as Dan fondly called him, ordered more blood cultures because he was reminded of something he had seen growing up on cattle farms. And the “country boy” doctor was on the right track. Cattle and other hooved animals in the upper Midwest are known to get anthrax, even though people rarely do. Dan thinks that doctor had a hand in saving his life.Dan Anders had a close-call with inhalation anthrax. His wife, Anne (in the background) calls him “Miracle Man.” Photo courtesy of the Star Tribune/Minneapolis-St. Paul, 2013So did the determined lab technician who helped Dan on a late Friday afternoon. She drove her own car to get the culture, which had been identified as a type of Bacillus bacteria, to the overnight delivery service just 15 minutes before the last pick up. The Minnesota Department of Health laboratory, part of the Laboratory Response Network, worked overtime that weekend and quickly made the determination: this was the highly lethal Bacillus anthracis that causes anthrax. CDC was notified immediately and started the protocol for anthrax. Had the lab results been held up until Monday, Dan’s not sure he would have made it through the weekend.Dan was transported by a medical aircraft to a larger hospital in Minneapolis. Despite being terribly ill, he remembers that he insisted that his wife not drive him the long distance to the hospital. Another good call, because he might not have survived the trip.Inhalation anthrax produces toxins that can quickly cause multisystem organ failure. Dan recalls that they “gave him less than a 5% chance of making it.” CDC rushed in a specialized antitoxin (anthrax immunoglobulin) and sent two medical officers to monitor the treatment. Dan, close to death in a medically induced coma, began to respond. He thinks CDC’s rushing in the anthrax immunoglobulin was the turning point in his battle to survive. He recently reflected, “Ever since I got back home, I’ve wanted to call CDC to thank them for saving my life. I just didn’t know who to call.”“Ever since I got back home, I’ve wanted to call CDC to thank them for saving my life. I just didn’t know who to call.”—Dan AndersFortunately, Dan was well enough to be discharged a few weeks later, on August 29. However, his weakened state meant that he needed a cane to get around and was facing a long recovery ahead. Even 2 years after his close-to-death encounter with anthrax, he deals with after-effects, like low energy, muscle aches, and migraine headaches. But he acknowledges that there’s also been a good side effect—every day he wakes up feeling lucky to be alive.Yet there’s still the nagging question that will probably never be answered—how and where did he get the anthrax? After Dan recovered, CDC and state and federal partners combed through data and examined potential exposures encountered on his trip— from rocks he collected for making jewelry to bison herds he and his wife drove through— but were never able to identify the source of his exposure to anthrax. Just why he— and not his wife Anne—got the deadly infection remains a mystery. To this day, Anne calls him “Miracle Man.”", "reports": [{"diseases": [], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "2011-12-2 xx:xx:xx", "locations": [{"geonames_id": 5037779}, {"geonames_id": 5037779}, {"geonames_id": 5037779}, {"geonames_id": 5037779}, {"geonames_id": 5037779}]}]},

All were travelers visiting or returning to the United States from affected areas in Asia, Africa, or the Indian Ocean.In late 2013, the first local transmission of chikungunya virus in the Americas was identified in Caribbean countries and territories. Local transmission means that mosquitoes in the area have been infected with the virus and are spreading it to people.Beginning in 2014, chikungunya virus disease cases were reported among U.S. travelers returning from affected areas in the Americas and local transmission was identified in Florida, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.For 2014 final data, click here.For 2015 final data, click here.For 2016 final data, click here.For 2017 final data, click here.For 2018 final data, click here.For 2019 provisional data, click here.For 2020 provisional data, click here.National & state maps (including county-level data) from 2003 – present.", "reports": [{"diseases": [], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "2006-12-xx xx:xx:xx to 2006-12-xx xx:xx:xx", "locations": [{"geonames_id": 4272021}, {"geonames_id": 4272021}, {"geonames_id": 4272021}, {"geonames_id": 4272021}]}]},

Additional cases were confirmed in multiple health zones in western DRC. The Institut National de Recherche Biomédicale (INRB) in Kinshasa confirmed Ebola virus, species Zaire ebolavirus, in this outbreak.Laboratory sequencing showed that most cases in this outbreak were the result of a new spillover event (i.e. a new introduction of the virus into the community from an animal reservoir) followed by person-to-person spread. Sequencing efforts also identified a few cases which appeared to be linked to the prior Equateur Province outbreak in 2018, possibly due to sexual transmission or relapse of a survivor.On November 18, 2020, after reaching 42 days (two incubation periods) with no new cases after the last survivor tested negative and was released from the Ebola treatment center, the DRC Ministry of Health and WHO announced the outbreak was over. In total, 130 cases (probable and confirmed) and 55 deaths were reported. The outbreak will be followed by 90 days of additional Ebola surveillance to ensure that any new cases are quickly detected and responded to.Dikembe Mutombo Ebola PSAEbola Outbreak Responder Stories Travelers’ Health for Clinicians2018 Eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo Ebola Outbreak MapTravelers’ HealthEbola Recommendations for Organizations", "reports": [{"diseases": ["ebola haemorrhagic fever"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "2018-xx-xx xx:xx:xx", "locations": [{"geonames_id": 216661}, {"geonames_id": 216661}, {"geonames_id": 216661}, {"geonames_id": 216661}, {"geonames_id": 216661}, {"geonames_id": 216661}]}]},
