For more information, see CDC\u2019s Advice to Clinicians.\nThe investigation is ongoing. CDC will provide updates when more information is available.\n\nAdvice to Pet Owners and Pet Store Workers\n\nAdvice to Pet Owners\nPuppies and dogs can carry Campylobacter germs that can make people sick, even while appearing healthy and clean. People who own or come in contact with puppies or dogs should take steps to stay healthy around their pet.\nAlways wash your hands\u00a0thoroughly with soap and water after touching your puppy or dog, after handling their food, and after cleaning up after them.\n\nAdults should supervise handwashing for young children.\nIf soap and water are not readily available, use hand sanitizer until you are able to wash your hands with soap and water.\nWash your hands after cleaning up urine (pee), feces (poop), or vomit from your puppy or dog. Clean up any pee, poop, or vomit inside the house immediately. Then disinfect the area using a water and bleach solution.\nDon\u2019t let dogs lick around your mouth and face.\nDon\u2019t let dogs lick your open wound or areas with broken skin.\nTake your dog to the veterinarian regularly to keep it healthy and to help prevent the spread of disease.\n\nWithin a few days after getting a new puppy or dog, take it to a veterinarian for a health check-up.\n\nWhen choosing a pet dog, pick a puppy or dog that is bright, alert, and playful.\nSigns of illness include appearing lethargic (sluggish or tired), not eating, having diarrhea, and breathing abnormally. However, even a dog that appears healthy can spread germs to people and other animals.\nIf your dog becomes sick soon after purchase or adoption, take your dog to a veterinarian promptly and inform the pet store, breeder, or rescue organization about the pet\u2019s illness. Thoroughly clean the area occupied by your pet by using a water and bleach solution.\n\nAdvice to Pet Store Workers\nPuppies and dogs can carry Campylobacter germs that can make people sick, even while appearing healthy and clean. People who handle puppies or dogs should take steps to stay healthy around these animals.\nAsk store management for training about handwashing, clean-up procedures, and other illness prevention measures.\nWash your hands with soap and water after handling puppies or dogs.\n\nWash your hands thoroughly with soap and water every time you handle dogs or anything in the area where they live and roam, including their food, treats, and food and water containers. Even a dog that appears healthy can spread germs to people and other animals.\nWash your hands immediately after cleaning up dog pee, poop, or vomit.\nDry hands using a clean paper towel or air-dry them. Do not dry hands on clothing.\n\nEat and store your food safely.\n\nAlways eat and drink in designated areas away from places where animals are kept and exercised.\nKeep your food away from areas where pet food and treats are stored, and away from areas where animals are kept or exercised.\nIf there isn\u2019t a separate refrigerator for pet food, store food for people on top shelves, above food, treats, and other supplies for pets.\n\nClean up messes safely.\n\nClean up any pee, poop, or vomit immediately, and disinfect the area according to store protocols.\nUse disposable gloves for clean-ups and wash your hands thoroughly afterwards.\nWash work shoes or boots, clothes, and equipment regularly, and do so in an area that is not used to store or prepare food for people.\nHave shoes or boots that are only worn and stored at the workplace.\n\nFollow store protocols for identifying and reporting sick or injured animals.\nLet your employer know if you or other employees become ill, especially with diarrhea or vomiting.\nPractice responsible use of antibiotics in pet stores.\n\nOnly give antibiotics to animals under the direct supervision of a veterinarian.\nVeterinarians should use appropriate diagnostic tests to ensure that animals receive the right treatment.\nMonitor and document antibiotic use in pet stores.\nEducate breeders, brokers, and transporters who supply animals to pet stores about responsible use of antibiotics and the benefit of veterinary supervision of antibiotic use.\n\nSymptoms of Campylobacter Infection in People\n\n\nMost people infected with Campylobacter infection develop diarrhea (often bloody), fever, and stomach cramps 2 to 5 days after being exposed to the bacteria.\nThe illness usually lasts about a week and most people recover without antibiotic treatment.\nAntibiotics are needed only for patients who are very ill or at high risk for severe disease, such as people with severely weakened immune systems.\n\nInvestigation DetailsDecember 17, 2019\nCDC and public health officials in several states are investigating a multistate outbreak of multidrug-resistant human Campylobacter jejuni infections linked to contact with puppies from pet stores.\nPublic health investigators are using the PulseNet system to identify illnesses that may be part of this outbreak. PulseNet is the national subtyping network of public health and food regulatory agency laboratories coordinated by CDC. DNA fingerprinting is performed on Campylobacter bacteria isolated from ill people by using a standardized laboratory and data analysis method called whole genome sequencing (WGS). CDC PulseNet manages a national database of these sequences that are used to identify possible outbreaks. WGS gives investigators detailed information about the bacteria causing illness. In this investigation, WGS showed that bacteria from people infected with Campylobacter were related genetically to each other. This means that people in the outbreak are more likely to share a common source of infection. WGS also showed that bacteria from people infected with Campylobacter in the current outbreak are related genetically to a 2016\u20132018 outbreak of multidrug-resistant Campylobacter infections linked to pet store puppies.\nAs of December 17, 2019, a total of 30 people infected with Campylobacter have been reported from 13 states. A list of the states and the number of confirmed cases in each state can be found on the Map of Reported Cases page.\nIllnesses started on dates ranging from January 6, 2019, through November 10, 2019. Ill people range in age from 8 months to 70 years, with a median age of 34; 52% of ill people are female. Of 26 people with information available, 4 hospitalizations have been reported. No deaths have been reported.\nIllnesses might not yet be reported due to the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is reported.\nWGS analysis of 26 isolates from ill people predicted antibiotic resistance to tetracycline (26 isolates), ciprofloxacin (25), nalidixic acid (25), azithromycin (23), erythromycin (23), clindamycin (23), telithromycin (23), and gentamicin (18). Testing of one outbreak isolate using standard antibiotic susceptibility testing methods by CDC\u2019s National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) laboratory confirmed these results.\nInvestigation of the Outbreak\nEpidemiologic and laboratory evidence indicate that puppies purchased from pet stores are the likely source of this outbreak. Many of the cases had contact with puppies or were employees at pet stores, including Petland.\nCDC included ill people in this outbreak if\n\ntheir stool (poop) sample grew Campylobacter jejuni in the laboratory (called a culture-confirmed infection) and they also had a link to puppies, or\nthey had a culture-confirmed Campylobacter jejuni infection that was closely related genetically to a confirmed puppy-linked case by WGS.\n\nIn interviews, ill people answered questions about dog, puppy, and other exposures they had in the week before they became ill. Of 24 people interviewed, 21 (88%) reported contact with a puppy in the week before illness started, and 15 (71%) of those 21 people reported contact with a puppy from a pet store. When asked about the specific pet store, 12 (80%) of those 15 people reported either having contact with a puppy or working at a Petland store.\nInvestigators reported eight more ill people who had contact with a puppy at Petland and had a diagnostic test\u00a0showing they were infected with Campylobacter bacteria. However, CDC did not include these people in the outbreak case count because no bacterial samples were available for WGS. Public health investigators use WGS to identify illnesses that are part of multistate outbreaks.\nA single, common supplier of puppies has not been identified. This investigation is ongoing. CDC will provide updates if more information becomes available.\n\nOutbreak By the Numbersmap iconMap of Reported Caseschart iconTimeline of Reported CasesKey Resources\nAdvice to Clinicians\nAdvice to Veterinarians\nCampylobacter website\nHeathy Pets Heathy People website\nNational Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) website\nWhen and How to Wash Your Hands\nPet Food Safety", "reports": [{"diseases": [], "syndromes": [], "event_date": "", "locations": []}]}{"url": "https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/basic_information/e-cigarettes/severe-lung-disease.html", "date_of_publication": "2020-11-27 xx:xx:xx", "headline": "Outbreak of Lung Injury Associated with the Use of E-Cigarette, or Vaping, Product", "main_text": "Outbreak of Lung Injury Associated with the Use of E-Cigarette, or Vaping, Products\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCDC, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), state and local health departments, and other clinical and public health partners are investigating a national outbreak of e-cigarette, or vaping, product use-associated lung injury (EVALI).\nFor Healthcare Providers\n\n\nFor Health Departments\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nResources\n\n\nDigital Press Kit\n\n\n\n\n\nOn This Page\n\n\n\nOverviewWhat We KnowWhat CDC RecommendsKey Facts about E-Cigarette Use, or VapingKey Facts about Vitamin E Acetate \n\nLatest InformationMap of Reported CasesEpi Chart of Reported Hospital AdmissionsWhat CDC is Doing \n\n\n\n\n\ncalendar alt icon Updated February 25, 2020, at 1:00 PM EST\n\nOverview\nEmergency department (ED) visits related to e-cigarette, or vaping, products continue to decline, after sharply increasing in August 2019 and peaking in September.\nNational and state data from patient reports and product sample testing show tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)-containing e-cigarette, or vaping, products, particularly from informal sources like friends, family, or in-person or online dealers, are linked to most EVALI cases and play a major role in the outbreak.\nVitamin E acetate is strongly linked to the EVALI outbreak. Vitamin E acetate has been found in product samples tested by FDA and state laboratories and in patient lung fluid samples tested by CDC from geographically diverse states. Vitamin E acetate has not been found in the lung fluid of people that do not have EVALI.\nEvidence is not sufficient to rule out the contribution of other chemicals of concern, including chemicals in either THC or non-THC products, in some of the reported EVALI cases.\n\nCDC will continue to update guidance related to EVALI as appropriate.\n\n\n\n\nWhat We KnowAbout the Outbreak:\n\nAs of February 18, 2020, a total of 2,807 hospitalized EVALI cases or deaths\u00a0have been reported to CDC from all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and two U.S. territories (Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands).\n\nSixty-eight deaths have been confirmed in 29 states and the District of Columbia\u00a0(as of February 18, 2020).\n\n\nEmergency department (ED) visits related to e-cigarette, or vaping, products continue to decline, after sharply increasing in August 2019 and peaking in September.\n\nNational ED data and active case reporting from state health departments around the country show a sharp rise in symptoms or cases of EVALI in August 2019, a peak in September 2019, and a gradual, but persistent decline since then.\nReasons for the decline are likely multifactorial and may be related to the following:\n\nIncreased public awareness of the risk associated with THC-containing e-cigarette, or vaping, product use as a result of the rapid public health response.\nRemoval of vitamin E acetate from some products.\nLaw enforcement actions related to illicit products.\n\n\n\n\nLaboratory data show that vitamin E acetate, an additive in some THC-containing e-cigarette, or vaping, products, is strongly linked to the EVALI outbreak.\n\nA recent studyexternal icon analyzed samples from 51 EVALI cases from 16 states and a comparison group of samples from 99 comparison individuals without EVALI for vitamin E acetate, plant oils, medium chain triglyceride (MCT) oil, coconut oil, petroleum distillates, and diluent terpenes.\nVitamin E acetate was identified in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid samples (fluid samples collected from the lungs) from 48 of the 51 EVALI patients, but not in the BAL fluid from the healthy comparison group.\nNo other toxicants were found in BAL fluid from either group, except for coconut oil and limonene (1 EVALI patient each).\n\n\nIn August 2019, CDC started collecting data from states on EVALI cases using a standardized case report form. The data were voluntarily collected and submitted by each state to CDC on a routine basis. Due to the subsequent identification of the primary cause of EVALI, and the considerable decline in EVALI cases and deaths since a peak in September 2019, CDC stopped collecting these data from states as of February 2020.\n\nHowever, CDC continues to monitor EVALI-related trends using emergency department data from the National Syndromic Surveillance Program\u2019s BioSense/ESSENCE platform. These data do not suggest a resurgence of EVALI at this time.\nCDC encourages clinicians to continue to report possible cases of EVALI to their local or state health department for further investigation.\n\n\nCDC will continue to provide assistance to states, as needed, related to EVALI and will provide any updates at: www.cdc.gov/EVALI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat CDC Recommends\nCDC and FDA recommend that people not use THC-containing e-cigarette, or vaping, products, particularly from informal sources like friends, family, or in-person or online dealers.\nVitamin E acetate should not be added to any e-cigarette, or vaping, products. Additionally, people should not add any other substances not intended by the manufacturer to products, including products purchased through retail establishments.\nAdults using nicotine-containing e-cigarette, or vaping, products as an alternative to cigarettes should not go back to smoking; they should weigh all available information and consider using FDA-approved smoking cessation medicationsexternal icon. If they choose to use e-cigarettes as an alternative to cigarettes, they should completely switch from cigarettes to e-cigarettes and not partake in an extended period of dual use of both products that delays quitting smoking completely. They should contact their healthcare professional if they need help quitting tobacco products, including e-cigarettes, as well as if they have concerns about EVALI.\nE-cigarette, or vaping, products (nicotine- or THC-containing) should never be used by youths, young adults, or women who are pregnant.\nAdults who do not currently use tobacco products should not start using e-cigarette, or vaping, products.\nTHC use has been associated with a wide range of health effects, particularly with prolonged frequent use. The best way to avoid potentially harmful effects is to not use THC-containing e-cigarette, or vaping, products.\nPersons engaging in ongoing cannabis use that leads to significant impairment or distress should seek evidence-based treatment by a healthcare professional.\n\n\nTop of Page\n\n\nKey Facts about Use of E-Cigarette, or Vaping, Products\nElectronic cigarettes\u2014or e-cigarettes\u2014are also called vapes, e-hookahs, vape pens, tank systems, mods, and electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS).\nUsing an e-cigarette is commonly called vaping.\nE-cigarettes work by heating a liquid to produce an aerosol that users inhale into their lungs.\nThe liquid can contain: nicotine, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabinoid (CBD) oils, and other substances, flavorings, and additives. THC is the psychoactive mind-altering compound of marijuana that produces the \u201chigh.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nKey Facts about Vitamin E Acetate\nVitamin E acetate is used as an additive, most notably in THC-containing e-cigarette, or vaping, products.\nVitamin E is a vitamin found in many foods, including vegetable oils, cereals, meat, fruits, and vegetables. It is also available as a dietary supplement and in many cosmetic products, like skin creams.\nVitamin E acetate usually does not cause harm when ingested as a vitamin supplement or applied to the skin. However, previous research suggests that when vitamin E acetate is inhaled, it may interfere with normal lung functioning.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have questions about CDC\u2019s investigation into the lung injuries associated with use of e-cigarette, or vaping, products, contact CDC-INFO or call 1-800-232-4636.\n\n\n\n\nLatest Information\nAs of December 3, 2019, CDC is only reporting hospitalized EVALI cases and EVALI deaths regardless of hospitalization status. CDC has removed nonhospitalized cases from previously reported case counts. See\u00a0Public Health Reporting\u00a0for more information.\nAs of February 18, 2020, a total of 2,807 hospitalized e-cigarette, or vaping, product use-associated lung injury (EVALI) cases or deaths have been reported to CDC from 50 states, the District of Columbia, and two U.S. territories (Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands).\nSixty-eight deaths have been confirmed in 29 states and the District of Columbia (as of February 18, 2020):\n\nAlabama, California (4), Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida (2), Georgia (6), Illinois (5), Indiana (6), Kansas (2), Kentucky, Louisiana (2), Massachusetts (5), Michigan (3), Minnesota (3), Mississippi, Missouri (2), Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York (4), Oregon (2), Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee (2), Texas (4), Utah, Virginia and Washington (2).\nThe median age of deceased patients was 49.5 years and ranged from 15-75 years (as of February 18, 2020).\n\n\nAmong the 2,668 hospitalized EVALI cases or deaths reported to CDC (as of January 14, 2020):\n\n\n\n66% were male\nThe median age of patients was 24 years and ranged from 13\u201385 years.\nBy age group category:\n\n15% of patients were under 18 years old;\n37% of patients were 18 to 24 years old;\n24% of patients were 25 to 34 years old; and\n24% of patients were 35 years or older.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2,022 hospitalized patients had data on substance use, of whom (as of January 14, 2020):\n\n82% reported using THC-containing products; 33% reported exclusive use of THC-containing products.\n57% reported using nicotine-containing products; 14% reported exclusive use of nicotine-containing products.\n\n\n50% of EVALI patients who reported using THC-containing products provided data on product source (as of January 7, 2020):\n\n16% reported acquiring products only from commercial sources (recreational and/or medical dispensaries, vape or smoke shops, stores, and pop-up shops).\n78% reported acquiring products only from informal sources (family/friends, dealers, online, or other sources).\n6% reported acquiring products from both commercial and informal sources.\n\n\n54% of EVALI patients who reported using nicotine-containing products provided data on product source (as of January 7, 2020):\n\n69% reported acquiring products only from commercial sources.\n17% reported acquiring products only from informal sources.\n15% reported acquiring products from both commercial and informal sources.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of Hospitalized EVALI Cases or Deaths Reported to CDC as of February 18, 2020\n\n\n\nDates of symptom onset and hospital admission for patients with lung injury associated with e-cigarette use, or vaping \u2014 United States, March 31, 2019\u2013February 15, 2020\n\nTop of Page\n\n\nFor more information and resources for key stakeholders, visit For Healthcare Providers and For State and Local Health Departments.
